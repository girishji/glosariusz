Those above the threshold pay income taxes based on a progressive scale. In the USA, for example, the poorest 20% of households had an average income tax rate of –10% of mini- mum income (”The Economist”, 15 April 2006, p. 49). The logic of the negative income tax system is to provide a continuum of incentives to earn more income regardless of your level of income. It avoids the situation where welfare recipients have a disincentive to find work because incremental income will be taxed at the same time as welfare payments are lost.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4666">Negligence </a><a href="part1037.htm#bookmark2556" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Zaniedbanie </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="p">Being irresponsible – either acting or failing to act- so as to harm others. Professional or business negligence is characterized chiefly by inadvertence, thoughtlessness and inattention. The worse transgression of “criminal” negligence goes into the realm of a wilful “wantonness” or “recklessness” and merits more punishment. If the essence of negligence is making an “inexcusable” mistake, how do we distinguish this from an “honest” error, especially since the exercise of business judgement is inherently</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">error-prone? There is no set definition (hence the need to often resort to a court of law). Certainly the extent of damages is a consideration. Another consideration is to invoke a standard of care that is based on what a “reasonable” or “prudent” person would do in the same circumstances. Negligence is a particular issue with professionals and those with a high <i>fiduciary </i>duty of care. In the case of <i>auditors</i>, they must often defend themselves against accusers when an <i>audit failure </i>occurs.

To be clear, we are not advocating the elimination of <span class="s109">liability </span>when defects occur, whether in financial reporting by companies or in auditing by accounting firms. We remain committed to substantially improve audit quality and to reduce the occurrence of audit defects while working constructively with regulators to improve audit standards around the world. But exposure to liability must be proportionate and fair, and the liability system is now clearly out of balance.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 117pt;padding-right: 22pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Samuel DiPiazza, Chief Executive Officer, PricewaterhouseCoopers, <span class="s113">2005 Annual Review</span></p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 62%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4667"><span class="s22">Negligence, Standard of Conduct </span></a><span class="s38">(USA) </span><a href="part1037.htm#bookmark2557" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part1037.htm#bookmark2557" class="s25">Zaniedbanie, kwalifikacja </a><span class="s39">prawna </span><span class="s23">• </span>A standard of conduct for <i>management </i>that can expose it to individual legal</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">punishment.
