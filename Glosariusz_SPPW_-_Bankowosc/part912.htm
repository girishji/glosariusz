During the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, many banks faced liquidity shocks as credit markets froze up and large debts could not be rolled over (see quote below). The ones that could not cope either failed (see <i>Lehman Brothers</i>) or had to be rescued. Regulators now insist that a bank should have enough access to cash to withstand severe, month-long liquidity shock.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2555">Liquidity vs. Solvency (Distinction in Banking) </a><a href="part333.htm#bookmark1181" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part333.htm#bookmark1181" class="s24">Płynność a wypłacal- </a><span class="s60">ność (w bankowości) </span><span class="p">– Under most bankruptcy laws, whether a borrower</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">is “solvent” is defined by two tests: i) does their balance sheet have a positive amount of shareholder’s equity in order to protect creditors by absorbing losses? and ii) can their obligations be met as they come due? The former, a measure- ment test, tends to be sustained by profitability while the later, a behavioural test, requires sufficient liquidity as well as a degree of forbearance by creditors to wait (the “come due” part). In the case of banks, the liquidity test can be practically ignored so long as depositor confidence can be maintained and a <i>run </i>averted. This makes banking a kind of a <i>confidence game</i>. So long as people think that a bank is safe, most of its depositors will refrain from demanding payment (ex- cept perhaps to test it now and then). What if a bank is confronted with sudden but limited demands for payment? These can be satisfied by drawing down on its cash reserves or by borrowing from others (from a <i>lender of last resort </i>if need be). This is a capability that distinguishes a “bank” from a normal com- mercial enterprise. Accordingly, in normal times, banks and their regulators traditionally tend to focus on the balance sheet aspect of the solvency test i.e. sufficient capital to absorb losses so that bank equity will always be reliably pre- served. Hence, the importance placed on capital adequacy. For banks, unlike their borrowers, abundant liquidity was not necessarily a virtue. Indeed, excess cash was a non-earning asset that harmed viability (see <i>bank earnings formula</i>). It was <i>Bagehot </i>who articulated the idea that sound banks (in the sense of their capital and profitability) might find themselves temporarily short of liquidity if market conditions where in a state of <i>panic</i>. These in turn justified rescues by a <i>central bank </i>in its lender-of-last-resort role and a certain relaxation about the need for cash reserves (say, 1% to 5% being considered adequate). However, there can be a nexus between illiquidity and insolvency. This was demonstrated in the 1930s (see quote below) and the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009. When banks hold traded assets or assets measured at their fair value, a dearth of market liquidity can depress balance sheet values. The resultant value destruction on bank balance sheets then can raise doubts about a bank’s solvency which in turn may trigger large withdrawals, especially amongst large wholesale depositors in the money market who are highly risk averse. The nexus can create a nasty, self-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="93" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4006.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part911.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part913.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
