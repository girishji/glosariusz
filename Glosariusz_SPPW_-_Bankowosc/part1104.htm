For such a small nation, there is a plethora of banking with more than 350 banks operating in highly seg- mented markets: two global banks, cantonal-owned banks, regional banks, co- operative banks (‘raiffeisen’), private banks and foreign banks. Capitalising on the country’s long-standing neutrality and safe-haven status, Swiss banks enjoy a global niche for their discrete <i>private banking </i>services for the world’s uber-rich. Reinforced by strict secrecy laws, Swiss banks prospered to the point that their</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">three largest banks now account for about 75% of the country’s banking assets. In relation to the Swiss GNP, such banks now pose a <i>too-big-to-save problem </i>and are being consciously down-sized and/or fortified with extra bank capital. Swiss banks have been pilloried for holding “Holocaust cash” (i.e. undisclosed dormant deposits) and even facilitating criminal activity (for example, the plot of the 1996 Hollywood thriller “Broken Arrow” has the nuclear blackmailer of the American government demand his ransom be paid in to a “Swiss bank ac- count” as if such a heinous crime could be beyond the reach of the US authori- ties). Others have suggested even more sinister themes (see quote below). Such fictional claims are perhaps no more than a dramatic example of <i>bank bashing</i>. Recently, a more damning indictment of Swiss banking is a tarnished reputa- tion for soundness. After the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, several Swiss banks lost much of their lustre as rock-solid financial institutions immune to turmoil. The giant Union Bank of Switzerland with a $1.5 trillion balance sheet seems the most accident prone. In the credit crisis UBS was mocked as being “Used to Be Smart” after losing $50 billion in toxic assets and needing a government bail- out. While the financial crisis was daunting for many banks, UBS’s huge losses were a sacrilege for any bank with a reputation for being ultra-prudent.
