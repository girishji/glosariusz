The resulting shortage, or appearance of a shortage, will in turn drive prices up. As a result, there is a potential profit to be had from holding gains. A risk is that the market may not respond or the buyer will go broke in the process of accu- mulating the asset. Furthermore, unless the transaction is transparent, it can be regarded as a fraud by regulatory authorities. A notorious example of an attempt to corner the market was when the Hunt brothers of Texas tried to ma- nipulate silver prices in the 1980s, only to fail and lose millions.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 72%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3511"><span class="s21">Corporate Diplomacy </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part149.htm#bookmark383" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Dyplomacja korporacyjna </span><span class="s48">(żar- gon) </span><span class="s22">• </span>The exercise of <i>corporate governance </i>and <i>shareholder rights </i>through</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="407" height="241" alt="image" src="Image_4811.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Few Quiet Words</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Few Quiet Words</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Few Quiet Words</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">informal, behind-the-scenes means based on the expressed wishes of powerful groups of investors, especially <i>institutional investors</i>. This is contrasted with a more “democratic” but perhaps ineffectual exercise of shareholder rights via formal votes on motions at the shareholders’ <i>annual general meetings </i>or the use of <i>proxy votes</i>. Corporate diplomacy is said to be favoured in Britain although elements of such a mechanism are likely universal.
