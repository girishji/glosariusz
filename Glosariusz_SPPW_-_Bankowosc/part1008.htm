Because of its permanence (it won’t “disappear in the night”) and unassailable security in- terest through a fixed-charge registered mortgage, it seems like an ideal form of collateral security to many a banker. Moreover, in inflationary periods, real estate property tends to hold its real value. It’s as if banks took the whimsical ad- vice of the American humourist Will Rogers (1879–1935) seriously: “Buy land! It’s the one thing they’re not making any more of.” But the inherent vulnerability in real estate property financing is two-fold. First, as tempting as it might be, no intelligently crafted loan should be based primarily on pledged security. Rather a loan’s viability should be anchored on repayment capacity with collateral se- curity confined to a <i>second way out</i>. In this regard, speculative real estate that is</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">held for price appreciation offers a poor first way out because it is illiquid (fully rented property is another matter). In distress sale situations, idle property val- ues can easily plummet. Second, excessive real estate financing tends to cre- ate a self-deflating asset bubble as debt-financing investments push up prices, which in turn induce further investments until the bubble bursts. Ill-thought through real estate property lending has been the root cause of banking fiascos</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="47" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4375.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1007.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1009.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
