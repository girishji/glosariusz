In the words of an old saying: “Ignorance is bliss”. A lack of knowledge can in turn be a possible defence against being a party to the wrongdoing. For example, in cases of corporate fraud or conspiracy, accused CEOs might try to claim that they were unaware of the precise financial affairs of the company because these were “complex, technical or detailed”, etc. matters that had been delegated to the chief financial officer. The so-called “ostrich defence” may indeed be valid if the wrongdoing is sufficiently far removed from one’s normal sphere of control. A boss cannot be responsible for everything that goes on inside a firm. How- ever, such ignorance must be interpreted carefully whenever it is not credible, either because the boss should have known or was trying to avoid knowing in the first place. As the policeman tells drivers who claim they didn’t see the speed limit sign: “Ignorance of the law is no excuse”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="361" alt="image" src="Image_4782.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3475"><span class="s21">Consensus View (Stock Market) </span></a><a href="part358.htm#bookmark920" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Konsensus prognoz </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">A collective esti- </span>mate of a firm’s future quarterly <i>earnings </i>based on the collective views of <i>securi- ties research analysts</i>, often assisted by <i>guidance </i>from the firm.
