(In the case of business enterprises that have an infinite time horizon, a permanent level of debt is both normal and healthy so long as asset yields are greater than the cost of capital.) In many consumer socie- ties most households will incur long term debt for a <i>residential mortgage </i>(20–25 year repayment) or medium term instalment debt for the periodic purchase of an automobile (3–5 year repayment). This means that people should be generally debt free by, say, the age of 55 since faithful monthly payments will slowly but surely amortise term debt over time. Consistent with <i>life-cycle investing </i>(see the <i>Compendium of Finance</i>) households should then start to accumulate savings for their retirement (65+). Dispersed throughout the average lifetime there will also be intermittent credit card debt. But healthy amounts should <i>clean-up </i>regularly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3429.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">and not be a long term burden. This pattern is – or should be – the basic personal financial goal of most individuals earning an income who have a limited ‘window of opportunity’ in the job market. In Canada, for example, a poll conducted for the bank (CIBC) revealed that people in debt hope to be debt-free by the age of 55. But the poll also found that only about 35 per cent of people currently in the 55 to 64 age group actually achieved debt freedom. This suggests that people are incur- ring large amounts of high-interest revolving debt that is supporting – in relation to their earning power – an indulgent lifestyle when in fact they should be in a debt-reduction mode (see quote below). What of lender prudence and <i>respon- sible finance</i>? Driven by the self-interest of the profit-motive, lending institutions are usually willing to supply more debt to consumers regardless of the financial wisdom from the consumers’ perspective. While ‘caveat emptor’ (let the buyer beware) applies to purchasing decisions, it should “let the borrower be wary” in case of debt.
