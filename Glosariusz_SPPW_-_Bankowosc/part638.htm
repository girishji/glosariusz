Sound, well-run banks are not supposed to lose money. While adverse business conditions may sup- press earnings below shareholder targets (say, a 15% RoE), there will hopefully be no ‘red ink’ spilt. Banks typically either have enough ‘bench-strength’ from core earnings in their retail franchises or can call upon hidden reserves to buffer exceptional hits. When a bank losses money, its capital will be eroded. <i>Bank capital adequacy </i>could be threatened or, worse, if depositors are sufficiently alarmed, there could be a <i>run </i>on the bank. Banks are in the business of incur- ring risk, especially <i>credit risk</i>. But their expected losses (see <i>credit risk quanti- fication</i>) are an everyday ‘cost of doing business’ that should ideally be covered by risk premiums in their lending spreads. It is unexpected losses that can push</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">earnings into negative territory (see quote below). Under the <i>bank earnings for- mula </i>which suggests 1.1% return on earning assets net of risk costs of 1%, an unexpected loss greater than 1%+ of earning assets will wipe out annual profits. Such adversity (or misjudgement) is relatively rare. One reason why the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 was so traumatic was that many otherwise sound banks suffered large losses (see graph below). Even rock-solid <i>Swiss banks </i>lost money. That’s when people knew that the crisis was serious.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="153" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2794.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part637.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part639.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
