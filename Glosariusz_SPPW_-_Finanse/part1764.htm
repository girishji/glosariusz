Such provisions (which apply in most markets) are de- signed to protect the rights of minority shareholders who might be disadvan- taged if there is a change in control. It is also in the interests of transparency: everybody can respond to a take-over, not just larger, better informed investors. Mandatory offers prevent taking over a company surreptitiously by gradually and quietly mopping shares in the <i>free float</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4601"><span class="s21">Margin Account </span></a><a href="part361.htm#bookmark925" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Konto zabezpieczające marżę </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">An account at a stock </span>market broker’s in which traded shares are held as collateral security for the broker’s loan to an investor who uses the proceeds to buy the shares. Because the broker has physical possession of the shares and can easily liquidate them in the market to repay the loan, the lender’s <i>credit risk </i>is generally considered min- imal in the case of liquid, actively traded shares (illiquid shares in a thin market are another matter). The term ‘margin’ refers to the minimum amount that must be held in the account versus the loan. Thus a 50% margin stipulates that the loan can be no more than half the market value of the shares or offer secu- rity coverage of 200%. While assets are often leveraged, margin accounts are often considered speculative. For example, their widespread use in the 1920s was thought to be partly responsible for the Great Crash of 1929. Regulators</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">often stipulate minimum margin requirements based on prudential and public policy considerations.

While the borrower-in- vestor has the option of pledging more security, the typical response (since the bor- rower is, by definition, short of resources) is to sell some of the margined shares to restore coverage. If necessary, the whole loan may have to be repaid. The borrower has a very tight time frame to fix the problem after which the broker is authorised to proceed with a sell and repay transaction. Margin calls are an uncomfortable spot to be in. Borrowers are forced to sell shares because of their financial position as op- posed to having the option of holding until share prices rise.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="138" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_6256.png"/></span></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part1765.htm">Marginal Cost of Capital • MCC • Marginalny (krańcowy) koszt kapitału • The cost to a firm of the last amount of capital raised for its investment activities.
