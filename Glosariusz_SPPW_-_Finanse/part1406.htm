Arguments in favour of classifying it as “equity” include the lack of any existing legal liability (if taxes are owed to the government they will be classified as the current liability “taxes payable”) and the fact that timing reversals can be perpetually deferred if the enterprise is rein- vesting in depreciable assets. An intermediate argument could treat a stabile balance of deferred taxes as equivalent to a zero-interest loan which should be carried at a discounted value reflecting the time value of money. Depending on the circumstances (e.g. confidence in future growth of the company), an analyst might make an <i>analytical adjustment </i>to the financial statements for decision- making purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="238" alt="image" src="Image_5048.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anxiety</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anxiety</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anxiety</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3665">Deficit Spending </a><a href="part196.htm#bookmark503" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Finansowanie się deficytem (budżetowym) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">Paying for </span><span class="p">ongoing consumption or investment by borrowing from others.
