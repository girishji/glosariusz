This contrasts to a loan that is committed for a specified term (subject to an absence of <i>defaults</i>). A loan ‘on demand’ offers two advantages to a lender: an ability to react quickly to any unexpected changes in the borrower’s creditwor- thiness and an ability to exit from the lending process should funding sources dry up. The former made an ‘on demand’ tenor appropriate for short term <i>asset conversion </i>loans where the borrowing need was inherently temporary. Further- more, as a practical matter, floating interest rates meant that a loan contract had to be immediately adjustable. The later advantage was traditionally (see quote below) necessitated by a <i>matching </i>to the bank’s own <i>deposit </i>liabilities, many of which were also ‘on demand’. Loans might have to be liquidated to satisfy sud-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">den and large cash withdrawals, particularly if the bank faced a <i>run</i>. An ‘on de- mand’ tenor is also an intermediate step to initiate security realisation for a term loan in <i>default. </i>First, the uncured default puts the term loan ‘on demand’; then the loan is called. Assuming the borrower cannot satisfy the sudden demand for repayment, the lender then can legally proceed to security realisation. Lending with the legal right of demanding repayment on a whim can give a lender a false sense of power: once the money is `out of the vault’, nothing, no matter what the contract says, will see it easily return but a solvent, profitable and honest borrower. As well, the right of demand is constrained by the legal requirement to give <i>sufficient notice</i>. Thus, from a practical point of view, banks utilise their ‘on demand’ legal rights sparingly (a document search of Scotiabank’s 2008 an- nual report does not even bother to disclose the tenor of loan portfolios). Apart from situations were a bank genuinely wants to escape, the usefulness of an ‘on demand’ tenor is usually reserved for negotiating changes to the terms and conditions of the loan (“we’d like an immediate increase in interest rate; if you</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="150" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4236.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part963.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part965.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
