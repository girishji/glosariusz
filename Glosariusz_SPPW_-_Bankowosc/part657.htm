Established in 1975, it meets regularly at the Bank for International Settlements (the central bankers’ central bank) located in Basel (or Basle in English), Switzerland. Its mission is to promote a common denominator version of universally accepted best practices in banking regulation. While its recommendations are made by consensus and are not formally binding, its members (now expanded to include most of the world’s major economies) have voluntarily implemented them in one fashion or another in their own jurisdictions. In 1988, the Committee created a set of international banking regulations (see </span>basel capital accords<span class="p">) the most significant of which was an agreement on minimum </span>bank capital <span class="p">ratios to be applied against commonly defined </span>risk weighted bank assets<span class="p">. Over time, with hard lessons learned from experience and advances in risk management, the Basel Accords have evolved from ‘Basel I’ to a ‘Basel III’. The most laudable thing about the Basel Committee is its unity and its ability to overcome selfish national interests in the pursuit of global stability. Practically speaking it would be impossible for any one country to rebel against such a strongly unified orthodoxy. Such consensus-building stems from globalisation’s proneness to </span>systemic risk <span class="p">and the collective fear of </span>contagion <span class="p">(in the spirit of “we’re all in this together”). The Committee of ‘the Great and the Good’ is able to suggest to otherwise very powerful institutions what they should do by virtue of its credibility, expertise and </span>moral suasion <span class="p">in promulgating best practices. If it has a drawback, it is the Committee’s focus on large, international banks as opposed to smaller, domestic financial institutions that often require customised treatment. After the near-death experience of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, the Committee has even more prominence although regulatory regimes in both the USA and the EU are prepared to chart their own courses in the face of bank regulation having become more politisised.
