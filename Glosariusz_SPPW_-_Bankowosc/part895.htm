Such a borrower is fundamentally viable and sound but because of unusual circumstances finds themselves vulnerable to default. It thus deserves to survive (vs. fall prey to the <i>right to fail</i>). A lender of last resort must be strong in relation to the needy bor- rower so that their own creditworthiness will not be impinged upon by helping the recipient. In extremis, this means the ultimate lender of last resort falls back on a government authority with unlimited monetary creation powers (subject only to inflating the money supply). What prompts the lender of last resort’s largesse is having some stake in avoiding a borrower’s default. Often this might be a broader responsibility for the health of a financial system as a whole, which</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">could be threatened by the forces of <i>contagion</i>. A fundamental dilemma in play- ing what is at heart a paternalistic role is <i>moral hazard</i>: recipients might lose any sense of <i>financial discipline </i>if they know that they always might be rescued. To deal with this problem, the lender of last resort’s role is typically governed by some basic principles:</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">1. Charge a penalty price: Help from a lender of last resort should not come too cheaply. There should be an incentive to avoid depending on it if at all possi- ble. Furthermore, since the lender-of-last resort is taking a risk, they deserve to be compensated. Thus, a penalty interest is usually charged. Or, the very stigma associated from even needing such a loan often constitutes a dama- ged reputation. At the same time, however, the lender of last resort needs to lend generously and without price-gouging a disadvantaged borrower who, after all, the lender of last resort is trying to assist.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">2. Lend not subsidize: The lender of last resort is just that, a lender. They want and need to get their money back (if only to continue to be available to help others later on). If a loan goes unpaid, it is effectively a subsidy and equiva- lent to equity. A challenge in providing support is having confidence that an illiquid borrower is in fact solvent (see <i>liquidity vs. solvency distinction in banking</i>). If a borrower proves to be insolvent, helping them out will just de- lay and worsen the day of reckoning. Better to come to grips with the pro- blem by <i>restructuring, </i>debt relief or <i>liquidation</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">3. Insist on prudent behaviour: A lender of last resort should not stand by idly and be indifferent to the imprudent actions of a potential borrower, which in- crease the likelihood of reliance. Preventative measures can avoid any need to fall back on the lender of last resort (one reason why central banks are often at</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="148" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3925.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">994<span class="s53"> </span><span class="s28">Lender of Last Resort Role</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">the same time banking regulators). To be passively indifferent would be to im- plicitly condone the self-fulfilling behaviour the lender wants to avoid. In fact, good behaviour is one of the justifications for helping out (“they tried their best and so they deserve our sympathy”). All in all, a lender of last resort only really wants to help borrowers get out of trouble that is not of their own ma- king i.e. who have fallen victims to external circumstance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3926.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">A lender of last resort role can have many guises. In a family unit, parents of- ten play the role for their children (“you always can count on us if you are in a bind”). Governments can also play such a role when they respond to pres- sures exerted by the <i>too-big-to-fail doctrine</i>. In the financial markets, the ‘classic’ lender of last resort is a <i>central bank </i>that backstops the whole banking system by preventing <i>panic </i>should liquidity suddenly become scarce. <i>Bagehot </i>was one of the first to articulate the need for and legitimacy of a central bank lender of last resort role. The evolved structure of 19<span class="s342">th </span>century England’s banking sector pyramided concentrated pressures on the country’s sole reserves held by the <i>Bank of England</i>. This structure is inherent in fractional reserve banking which tends to be vulnerable to a mass <i>run </i>on deposits. The counter argument made in his day was that banks can be and should be self-reliant. It is arguably still a valid point (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3927.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Those banks that made it through [the credit crisis] compa- ratively well were those that had those banking basics as their founding principles.
