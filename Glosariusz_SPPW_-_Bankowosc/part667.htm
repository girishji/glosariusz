The paradox is, in fact, easily explained. Smaller loans are often secured, giving the bank a convenient <i>second way out</i>. They are also too small to justify a <i>recovery work-out</i>’s time and effort. Large corporate loans, in contrast, are often unsecured and confront the bank with a substantial loss if the bor- rower goes under. Finally, the troubles of very large borrowers can often attract the attention of the bank’s auditors, the financial press, <i>credit rating agencies </i>and banking supervisors. The borrower’s paradox is tempered by single name ex- posure rules which limit worst case losses to large borrowers to a prudent (say, 10–15%) share of <i>bank capital</i>. Compare to <i>banker’s paradox</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2918.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Owe the bank a million and they ‘own’ you; But owe the bank a billion and you ‘own’ them.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Anonymous Wit</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Owe the bank a million and they ‘own’ you; But owe the bank a billion and you ‘own’ them.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Anonymous Wit</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Owe the bank a million and they ‘own’ you; But owe the bank a billion and you ‘own’ them.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Anonymous Wit</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2919.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1865"><span class="s22">Borrowing Limitation </span></a><a href="part307.htm#bookmark1133" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Ograniczenie zadłużenia </span><b>– </b>A clause in a <i>loan agree- ment </i>or bond indenture which restricts total borrowings to a specified amount or ratio, including a borrowing base clause, in order to limit leverage to a pru- dent degree.

Legally, a branch is an integral part of the whole bank. Contrast with a subsidiary that is legally separate from its owner. Under <i>Scottish banking principles</i>, building up a branch network was a common strategy for most commercial banks. Branches were relatively independent but standardised full service providers within a locality under the sole control of an on-site <i>bank/branch manager</i>. Competition, deregulation and information technology is altering the role of the branch. Branch networks are increasingly treated as franchises segmented by profit potential and market niches. Services are customised to fit the needs of users. Suburban neigh- bourhood branches focus on mortgages and <i>deposits</i>. Downtown branches focus on commercial loans and cash management. With rise of electronic banking, many customers can be serviced without a branch, using ATMs and home banking.
