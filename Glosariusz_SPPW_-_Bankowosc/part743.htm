The use of fiat money and fractional reserve banking means that the volume of credit in an economy is only limited by the <i>prudence </i>of borrowers and <i>bankers’ judgement </i>of lenders. Banking regulations and de- positor confidence tend to be checks on only the most extreme and obvious abuses. In the meantime, credit volumes may get out of touch with economic reality. Since credit increases the money supply, it tends to drive up the demand for goods and services. If out of balance, inflation or an asset bubble can result. At its worst, this in turn can lead to <i>panic </i>and runs. To prevent this, monetary authorities must exercise controls that discourage extremes (when operating within healthy bounds, credit is best created by unfettered market forces). In the 19<span class="s342">th </span>century, the gold standard fulfilled the role of controlling credit by linking money supply to the physical, and inherently limited, supply of precious metal.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2084">Credit Crunch </a><span class="s52">(slang) </span><a href="part449.htm#bookmark1385" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Spadek kredytowania </span><span class="s32">(slang) </span><span class="p">– A general mood within a banking system whereby banks are reluctant to lend, even for suppos- edly creditworthy borrowers with acceptable risk. Borrowers then feel a crunch or “squeeze” in available credit. Money is said to be “tight”. As a result, fewer transactions are financed and general economic activity is curtailed. This in turn can exacerbate the problem in a self-reinforcing downward spiral of lost confidence. A flaw in the conception of niggardly bankers is that credit is always</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">„limited” and, relative to borrowers’ demands, usually scarce. During the reces- sionary phase of a business cycle, all businesses, some more than others, will tend to suffer from a weak economy’s reduced demand. It is not that banks won’t lend; it is that their customers don’t want to borrow. It is when credit is tight, regardless of such external conditions, and more due to the banker’s mindset, than a true credit crunch existing. Bankers, often by following a herd instinct amongst themselves, may lose touch with the marketplace’s realities. In recent times, the term ‘credit crunch’ has been used to describe the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009.
