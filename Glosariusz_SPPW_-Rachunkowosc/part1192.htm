Admittedly, there is a price to be paid for accrual accounting:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;"><span class="s41">◆ </span><b>complexity</b>: the books of record have to capture many other events besides cash trans- actions; the use of <i>double entry </i>accounting greatly facilitates this;</p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="s40">uncertainty</span><span class="p">: accruals require a prediction of the future. Near term accruals (e.g.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">accrual, period end<span class="p">) represent relatively few estimation problems whereas longer-term accruals (e.g. </span>depreciation<span class="p">) can be more difficult to accurately estimate. Consequently, the need to use </span>accounting estimates <span class="p">and </span>accounting judgements <span class="p">results in less certainty (Profit becomes an “estimate” versus a hard number). The </span>prudence accounting principle <span class="p">biases this uncertainty towards pleasant surprises;</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="s40">potential for manipulation</span><span class="p">: accounting estimates and accounting judgements are</span></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">necessarily subjective and will be prone to bias or worse purposeful distortion. This is the main reason why there is a need for an <i>attestation </i>function by independent <i>audi- tors </i>in financial reporting.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Despite these costs, accrual accounting is well worth it in terms of portraying <span class="s27">financial reality</span>. The essence of the trade-off is that <span class="s27">accounting users </span>would rather have approxi- mations of the correct measure than precision in the wrong measure.

Consider the purchase of inventory received in Period 1 and paid for in Period 2:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash accounting:</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">1. Period 1: Since transactions are not recognised unless they are completed in cash, there would be no entries on the books of a company until cash was received or disbursed. Note that there will be a distortion from any assets that are included in period 1’s financial statements by virtue of a physical count.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 114pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">debit (increase) <span class="s27">expenses</span>/assets 0</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">credit (increase) liabilities 0</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">2. Period 2: In the time period when cash was exchanged, the company will book an expense, or if future benefit will be received, an asset. If period 2 occurs after the accounting records of period 1 have been closed, the financial statements of both periods will be distorted.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 114pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">debit (increase) expenses/assets 512</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">credit (decrease) cash 512</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 310pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accruals (Period End)<span class="s40"> </span><span class="s36">687</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accrual accounting...</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">1. Period 1: To recognise the expense when the product is received or services are used, the expense or asset will be booked in the period of the transaction, defined as the physical receipt of goods or services or the incurring of a contractual liability. Notwithstanding that an invoice may not have been received, an estimate - called an “accrual” – will be made of the transaction’s value:</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 128pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">debit (increase) expenses/assets 500</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 164pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">credit (increase) accrued liabilities 500</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(an estimate of expense incurred in the period but payable in the next period)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">2. Period 2: To recognise the true liability when the invoice is received, a payable is cre- ated and the previous accrual is reversed.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 128pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">debit (decrease) accruals 512</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 164pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">credit (increase) payables 512</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(actual amount of goods or services received in the next period as indicated by an invoice)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">3. Period 2: To pay the invoice within its payment date will require a cash transaction that will reduce cash and eliminate the payable. Note that in terms of <i>working capi- tal</i>, there has been no change since both sides of the balance sheet have been reduced. There has been a reduction in the company’s <i>liquidity </i>but arguably an improvement in its <i>solvency </i>because it has satisfied a debt.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 128pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">debit (decrease) payables 512</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 164pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">credit (decrease) cash 512</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(payment of an invoice for goods or services)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">4. Period 2: Since accruals will seldom be so accurately estimated that they will equal the invoiced amount of the debt, there will inevitably be some amount – an “orphan”</p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">– left over in the accrual account. Since this amount is typically immaterial, it will simply be written off and taken into expenses, even though it arguably was attribut- able to period 1. (An alternative to a direct write-off of a difference is to use reversing entries to allow it to happen automatically.)</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 128pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">debit (increase) expenses 12</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 164pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">credit (increase) accrual 12</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(the difference between the accrued and the actual transaction amount)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We immediately appreciate that accrual accounting results in more complex accounting (1 entry vs. 4 entries) as well as wrong estimates (e.g. 12). However, the gains achieved in terms of more accurate reporting are well worth the trouble and inaccuracies. In prac- tice, period end accruals will be subject to the <span class="s27">materiality </span>convention: small items may be expensed as incurred rather than bothering to precisely match expenses to revenues.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1191.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1193.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
