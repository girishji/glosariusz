Such resistance might be for the sake of bidding up the price of the bid (a beneficial tactic for the target’s shareholders) or because incumbent management fears for its own personal interests (see <i>agen- cy problem</i>). Resistance might be mounted by a publicity campaign to persuade shareholders that future prospects (perhaps after some appropriate restructuring) will be brighter if the target remains independent. Another form of resistance to a particular bid is to attract an alternative buyer as a so-called <i>white knight </i>(i.e. heroic helper). A less legitimate resistance tactic is the use of <i>poison pills </i>which try to ruin a company’s attractiveness to bidders and which are ultimately contrary to shareholder interests. <i>Poison pills </i>are now either banned or discouraged in most progressive investor regimes.

As a voice of big business, the Hundred Group has exerted lobbying influence on matters affecting its interests such as stock exchange rules, accounting standards, adoption of the Euro, taxation and regulation. Such influence peddling is a natural outcome of the British political system where lobbying is conducted “behind the scenes” (versus registered lobbying in the USA).

The hurdle rate is a discretionary amount set by <i>management</i>. It should be anchored to the enterprise’s <i>cost of capital</i>. However, a shortage of funds or a desire to compen- sate for project risk may lead management to set the rate higher and thus under- take fewer projects by being more selective. Alternatively, low-risk projects or compliance expenditures may have a relatively lower hurdle rate to reflect their inherent attractions. The key logic in the use of a hurdle rate as investment cri- teria is that it is a healthy financial discipline that forces projects to be justified by strictly commercial considerations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="209" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_5812.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1646.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1648.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
