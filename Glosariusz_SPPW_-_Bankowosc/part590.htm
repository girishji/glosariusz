According to the <i>real bills doctrine </i>banks should only finance <i>bills of exchange </i>emanating from a transactionofgoodsorservices(i.e. whattodaywouldbedescribedas“accounts receivable financing”). Any loans based on faith in a borrower’s long term going concern were called “accommodation paper”. Often short-term credits, instead of repaying at maturity, were extended by liberal bankers. The absence of cash to repay was a sign of either cash flow deficits or a diversion of cash to capital expenditures. Under traditional banking conventions, accommodation was a bad thing. In extremis, it was even associated with the fraud of kiting. This was usually because the banker, who was perceived as doing the business an unwarranted favour, seldom knew the precise source or timing of <i>repayment</i>. Such acts of faith are only sensible when a bank is consciously making a <i>term loan</i>, with appropriate analysis and structure. The provenance of the word comes from the idea of doing a “kind favour”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="421" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2556.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accommodation <span class="s12">bill!

Key financial ratios (typically measuring profitability, solvency, liquidity, growth etc.) are compared to group norms and trends usually provided by data vendors such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Moody’s etc. Significant variances imply a degree of competitive performance or an aberration at least worth investigating and explaining. The logic at work is regression to a mean: if there is a certain observed performance level (for example a sector-wide debt-equity ratio averaging, say, 0.8:1), then individual firms should fit the pattern by virtue of being in the same competitive space. Such objective and fact-based benchmarking is better than arbitrary rules of thumb. That said, the univariate approach of one variable typically suffers from one variable’s results being offset by another. For example, a firm with relatively weak profitability might have relatively strong liquidity etc. Judgemental trade-offs are then needed to decide which variables count the most. For this reason, credit scoring tends to use a multivariate approach based on combining a few key selected ratios that are weighted by statistically proven bankruptcy prediction.
