Holdbacks, which are typically from 10% to 15% of the contract’s amount (often about the amount of the contractor’s budgeted profit)<i>, </i>are designed to protect the buyer/contractee against two risks:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">1. Defects in workmanship or technical performance by the contractor or his sub-contractors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">2. Unpaid sub-contractors of the contractor who may place a <i>mechanic’s lien </i>on the property and thereby cloud its title; since general contrac- tors may lack sufficient capital to complete a project without using trade credit or they may find themselves not paying for disputed work, the status of the contractor’s commercial relationships is of in- terest to the buyer/contractee.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Holdbacks are generally released upon a certification process by an in- dependent third party (e.g. in the case of a building, a consulting ar- chitect). Holdbacks present complications on two fronts. Contract ac- counting for the contractor’s income needs to address the potential for the holdback not being fully collected and thereby threatening the con- tract’s profit. If the buyer/contractee is using secured loans to finance the project, a lender with a <i>mortgage </i>as <i>collateral </i>will want confirmation that there are no competing claims to dilute their security. Thus, a lender will impose a holdback on a portion of the loan to the borrower. This last <i>tranche </i>will only be released when a title search on the constructed property shows a <i>clear title</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="129" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3809.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part868.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part870.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
