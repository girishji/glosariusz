So for example, a common credit enhancement measure in <i>small business lending </i>might be the provision of a personal guarantee by the owner/manager. The term is most commonly associated with derivatives and <i>securitisation </i>where mortgages, and other reli- able safeguards, can give market investors the degree of confidence they need to undertake the risks previously shouldered by the direct lender.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2104">Credit Insurance (Commercial/Trade) </a><a href="part496.htm#bookmark1475" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part496.htm#bookmark1475" class="s24">Ubezpieczenie kredytu (komer- </a><span class="s60">cyjnego) </span><span class="p">– Insurance against the possibility of bad debts amongst trade re-</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">ceivables. In exchange for an upfront premium, an enterprise will be compen- sated (typically 90%) in the event of a loss due to payment default (performance disputes are not covered). Insurers will review the debtor first, applying their own <i>credit analysis, </i>before accepting the risk or setting the premium. Should the insured choose to rely completely on the insurer’s underwriting decisions, the internal trade credit function can be effectively out-sourced. Credit insurance grew from the activities of factoring and credit collection companies who under- stood credit risks and could begin the price them. A related product is transac- tion assurance on internet activities. Larger businesses are usually more prepared to shoulder the bad debt risk on their everyday trade credit that they provide on open account. Their gross profit margins are typically high enough to give them a <i>risk appetite </i>in exchange for boosting sales. Their exposure can also be capped to tolerable amounts. Relations within the trade and the use of internal credit management tools (e.g. credit bureaus, bank references etc.) usually allow credit risk to be managed ‘in house’. Any bad debts expense (say, 2–3% of sales) is ac- cepted as a ‘cost of doing business.’ A common exception is export sales to foreign markets where both ascertaining buyer creditworthiness and debt recovery are more problematic. Here either <i>documentary letters of credit </i>can be used or <i>export credit agencies </i>can get involved. Credit insurance is the most appealing to <i>small and medium enterprises </i>who often cannot afford the <i>hit </i>of a bad loss, especially a concentrated account. Otherwise, their bank might be reluctant to accept un- insured receivables as collateral. Credit insurance tends to be more popular in Europe where the major players are Euler Hermes (Allianz Group), Atradius and Coface. Compare to <i>credit default swap</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2105"><span class="s22">Credit Insurance (Retail) </span></a><a href="part496.htm#bookmark1474" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Ubezpieczenie kredytu (detalicznego) </span><b>– </b>Insur- ance coverage of retail borrowers (especially for large debts such as automobile finance or <i>residential mortgages</i>) to protect the lender from the death/disability of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="115" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3283.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part748.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part750.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
