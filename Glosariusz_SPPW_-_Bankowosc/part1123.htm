Currently, Britain and Switzer- land, two countries which export banking services outside their borders, are confronted with the problem (see quote above). In the case of these countries, the <i>post-credit crisis response </i>is likely to be much tougher since they cannot afford to see a large bank fail.

In contrast to the spontaneous, and often desperate, request of a shore-up, a top-up is a prior commitment. If the top-up cannot be met, <i>default </i>occurs. In lieu of a top-up in the case of short-term loans, a lender can also insist on immediate pay-downs to restore a <i>coverage ratio</i>.

Sub-dividing a loan into tranches allows separate terms and conditions to be specified for sub-categories of debt.

This way, if the borrower’s performance proves to be deficient, the bank can hold back <i>availability </i>on the rest of the loan (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="164" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4902.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1122.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1124.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
