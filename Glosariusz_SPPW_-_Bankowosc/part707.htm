They are also a solid well adjusted team player. Apart from inherent personality traits, the nature of the job has a bearing on the commercial banker’s attributes. For exam- ple, the “relationship” nature of the client dealings means that there is more of a premium on patience, reflection and empathy (i.e. people relationship skills). The <i>credit culture </i>also emphasises methodical thoroughness, not creative zeal. Contrast this to the investment banker’s more “transactional” busi<s>n</s>ess that com- pels you to try to “beat the market” since “in any market, as in any poker game, there is a fool”. Finally, the regulation of commercial banking tended to shield it from the rigours of unbridled competition. This, in turn, tempers the raw com- mercial instincts and has traditionally made commercial banking a “calling” more than a trade.

Buyers of the ‘paper’ – named because they are unsecured <i>promissory notes </i>– are mostly money market mutual funds and cash-rich com- panies; issuers are over 1,700 top-rated corporates and <i>financial institutions</i>. The markets demand issuers with healthy credit ratings (Scotiabank’s Moody’s short term rating is “P-1”). For qualifying “tier one” issuers interest rates are typically low, even approaching government debt. CP was a financial innovation devel- oped in the USA in the early 1960s to give strong borrowers a financing vehicle that could trade freely without the direct trade connections or documentary requirements that can make a <i>bill of exchange </i>either unavailable or burden-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="134" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3081.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">804 <span class="s28">Commercial Paper (CP)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">some. Under US securities laws, commercial paper does not need a SEC reg- istration, being considered a loan instrument as opposed to a traded security. The secondary market for CP further enhances its financing appeal<i>. </i>Alongside the parallel development of money market funds, the CP market helped initiate the <i>disintermediation </i>process that began to radically alter the traditional bank- ing business model (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3082.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For more than 40 years, banking was profitable and sound...

Issuers use CP for general corporate purposes in lieu of short term bank credit. Ide- ally, given the <i>matching </i>principle, this should be for working capital purposes. However, when CP is continuously rolled over, issuers can get away with funding long-term investments at bargain interest rates. A variant of CP was the asset- backed version (ABCP) that funded securitised <i>special investment vehicles </i>(a.k.a. “conduits”) in attempts by many banks to move assets off their balance sheets. This market was decimated after the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 with sponsoring banks often having to step in when CP dried up. For various reasons the core (e.g. non-ABCP) CP market is showing signs of contraction (see graph below). The decline from 2000 to 2004 reflected excess liquidity by many corporate issu- ers and a tapping of the long term bond market during low interest rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="100" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3084.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part706.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part708.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
