When markets are freely competitive, the rest of the economy is also a winner. The risks a business chooses to run are inherent to the pursuit of profit maximisation in a calculated risk- reward trade-off. Given the <i>right to fail</i>, such risk-taking is generally a private matter for business owners wanting to reap the rewards of their commercial bets. Society at large is not disadvantaged (indeed, entrepreneurial risk-taking makes it better off; see <i>creative destruction</i>). That banks are somehow an exception to this dynamic is certainly not a new idea. As long ago as the late 18<span class="s342">th </span>century the Scots economist and “father of economics” Adam Smith articulated the essence of the problem. His vision of the invigorating “invisible hand” of</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">free markets was based on competitive enterprises that were typically sole proprietorships or partnerships. They lived or died by their own risk-taking;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="100" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2865.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">756 <span class="s28">Banks Are Special</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">a healthy discipline. Smith saw banks as being quite different. Even 200+ years ago, he recognised three profound insights: i) banks are more like public utilities with widespread social benefits and costs (what his modern counterparts would label ‘externalities’); ii) but they need large aggregations of capital that only joint stock companies can provide; iii) when managing such enterprises, managers will inevitably tend to be ‘negligent and profuse’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="417" height="459" alt="image" src="Image_2866.png"/></span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The only trades which it seems possible for a joint stock company to carry on successfully without exclusive privile- ge [i.e. which can freely compete] are those of which all the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a Routine, or to such uniformity of method that admits little or no variation. Of this kind is first the <b>banking trade </b>[as well as insurance, canals and water supply] (p. 242)... The great and general utility of banking when prudently mana- ged... is of greater and more general utility than the greater part of common trades... [but] it requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into a private firm of co-part- ners (p. 243)... [Alas] the directors of [joint stock] compa- nies, however, being the managers rather of other people’s money than their own, it cannot be well expected that they would watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which partners in a private firm of co-partners frequently watch over their own... Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company (p. 229).</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Selected excerpts from <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, Vol. II (1776),</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 298pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by Adam Smith</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Sure enough, as banking and public policy evolved after Smith, banks were treated as being ‘special’ (the free banking idea never gaining real acceptance). Banks were given exclusive privileges with charters and subsidised by an implicit, albeit ambiguous, government guarantee due to their <i>too big to fail </i>status. They were further buttressed by deposit insurance to stabilise their liabilities. A <i>lender of last resort </i>stood in the wings with emergency funding if ever needed. In return for such protection an implicit <i>social contract </i>constrained</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="100" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2867.png"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Banks Are Special <span class="s27">757</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">the operational freedom and dampened the risks of banks by <i>regulation</i>. Yet gradually over time, both the necessity and costs of the regulatory burden were seen as not justified. The <i>liberalisation </i>movement was a calculated bet that, by giving banks more freedom to behave like any other enterprise, economies would be better off without any attendant exposure to a meltdown. Banks became less special. Unshackled, the sector grew in size relative to the rest of the economy (by 2006, banks had become the largest sector in the “Financial Times” “Global 500” stock market index). But the trend did not play out well. The damage control defences against the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 cost tax payers dearly. Economic progress was set back many years. Today, banks are now seen as so potentially dangerous to social welfare that an American CEO of a major British bank has been labelled the “most dangerous man in Britain” (“The Independent” Newspaper, 9/9/10). This is all because Mr Robert Diamond, the CEO of Barclays, came close to buying <i>Lehman Brothers </i>Bank in 2008 just before it failed. If he had succeeded, the British public would have been ‘on the hook’ for a huge financial burden. No other sector’s business leader could merit such a dubious accusation. It is so difficult to quarantine banking folly from the rest of the economy that authorities are even thinking of making bank mismanagement a criminal offence (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2868.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The criminalisation route does not address the core of the problem [of prudent banking]...People make business mi- sjudgments in balancing risk and return, but that in banks, we want them to make a <b>different balance of risk and return from other sectors of the economy</b>... the difficulty we have in banking is that, when you take some of those risk/return tra- de-offs... there might be a disaster for the economy as well...
