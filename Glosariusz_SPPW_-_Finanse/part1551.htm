As well, absent specialization and intensive focus, is a single regulator really able to grasp what’s going on? How many staff would be sufficiently skilled to land a job in the companies they are overseeing? The ideal regulatory model has yet to be found. The <i>Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 </i>has humbled everybody. A meddling, bureaucratic regulator can clog up a healthy system with superficial interference. Even worse, it can instill a false sense of security (e.g. “Confidence is the feeling you get when you don’t fully understand the situation”). On the other hand, a lax, compromising regulator can let the “animal spirits” of unchecked competition get out of hand at the public’s expense. As in other markets, Poland’s regulatory environment is evolv- ing, trying to find the right balance between a “hands-off ” and “hands-on” role that deft regulation requires.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Unlike most countries, Poland did not have to support any financial institution with any direct financial aid financed by the tax payers.

Drawing analogies to terrorist threats, Buffett was concerned about the complexity, hidden, off-balance sheet ac- counting and destructive power of derivatives. Since his famous quote on p. 41, many of the concerns about derivatives have been tempered. For example, it is possible to reduce counterparty risk by buying <i>credit default swap </i>protec- tion or having exposures cash collateralized. Fair value accounting rules now require that derivatives be marked-to-market daily so there is immediate feedback as to their status.
