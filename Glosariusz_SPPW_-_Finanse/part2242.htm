The white knight bidder is typically encouraged to come forward by incumbent <i>management </i>who perceive either a better deal for <i>shareholders </i>(higher share purchase price or a better potential for synergies) or someone more sympathetic to their per- sonal interests (in terms of hiring or dismissing them).</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 72%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5856">Widespread Share Ownership (Impact of) </a><a href="part638.htm#bookmark1637" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part638.htm#bookmark1637" class="s23">Powszechny akcjonariat </a><span class="s33">(oddziaływanie) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">Ownership of stock market equity shares spread across a</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">large portion of the population. Households traditionally owned shares indi- rectly through intermediary financial institutions such as investment banks, insurance companies and pension funds. Because it required investor savvy and the financial resilience to withstand volatility, using common equity as a per- sonal savings vehicle was confined to either the wealthiest or most risk tolerant members of the society. The rest of us put our hard-earned savings into safer, simple instruments such as bank deposits, the <i>money market</i>, bonds or real estate. Over time, with more universal <i>financial literacy</i>, better access to information (especially via the internet) and innovations like <i>mutual funds</i>, more of the pub- lic are venturing into the stock market on their own. This tendency has become especially apparent in the 1990s. For example, by 2000, global stock market <i>capitalisation </i>had reached over 100% of global GNP, more than twice the capi- talisation in 1990. The trend is the most pronounced in developed countries with high GNP/capita where households directly owning shares range from a high of 50% (USA) to a low of 10% (Japan). There are far reaching implications from widespread share ownership (see table p. 149):</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Widespread share ownership will likely have a particularly profound impact on <i>financial reporting</i>. Issues that previously concerned just <i>Wall Street </i>– such as <i>earnings quality </i>and <i>audit risk </i>– will begin to be of interest to Main Street. The general public will start to pay more attention to matters that previously were only of interest to the financial community.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="252" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7994.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2241.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2243.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
