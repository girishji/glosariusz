Typical institutions of the exalted undoubted status are governments, banks and multi-national “Fortune 500” corporations who possess an AAA credit rating. Of course, the term is used as a convenient descriptive tool and not a literal commitment of unqualified, blind faith. Many an undoubted com- pany has found itself facing bankruptcy, its very unquestioned status having ru- ined it. Even the mighty Bank of England at one time had its moments. Perhaps a more common, and sensible, usage occurs with credit references where the term is confined to specific, and comparatively modest, amounts requested by enquirers e.g. “undoubted for your enquiry of $10,000”.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3173"><span class="s22">Undue Influence </span></a><a href="part243.htm#bookmark677" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Nacisk </span>– <span class="p">Unfair pressure being exerted on a third party to a lending agreement to provide collateral security that is contrary, or at least be- yond, their own interests. For example, a husband who owns a company might pressure or deceive his spouse into co-signing a mortgage on their shared resi- dential property to secure the debt of the husband’s business. Note that if the wife owned the business, it would be in her interests as well and undue influence, by definition, could not exist. In many countries with a tradition of strong </span>debtor’s rights<span class="p">, courts have set aside collateral security that was obtained with undue influence.
