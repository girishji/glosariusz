While they are subject to the same investment criteria, they are difficult to mea- sure in terms of benefits, productive life and market value. Some common examples include:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">development costs,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">patents and copyrights,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="s27">franchise </span><span class="p">rights and user licenses,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="s27">brand</span><span class="p">s and trademarks,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">advertising costs,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">start-up (licensing, legal fees etc.) costs,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">interest payments on pre-completion projects,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="s27">goodwill</span><span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Accounting standards<span class="s3">, which are based on the principle of </span>conservatism<span class="s3">, generally are biased in favour of expensing. This is largely out of consideration of </span>accounting users<span class="s3">. Creditors, for example, tend to be wary of intangibles since they cannot be liquidated and are dependent on the future sustainability of the </span>going concern<span class="s3">. Shareholders might suspect that the subjectivity inherent in valuing intangibles will lead to </span>earnings man- agement. <span class="s3">However, from an </span>economic value <span class="s3">perspective, intangibles may well hold con- siderable value (in some enterprises, even surpassing tangible values). Somewhat incon- sistently, many intangibles can be left on the balance sheet if they are purchased from a third party as opposed to internally generated.

As an <i>allocation </i>choice, financing costs, which relate to the passage of time, are normally treated as a <i>period expense</i>. However, <i>accounting standards </i>may allow exceptions to this if circumstances merit. For example, real estate assets that qualify as <i>investment proper- ties </i>can include interest in their <i>carrying value </i>since financing costs are inherent to their construction. Moreover, interest costs can usually be traced to the constructed property because lenders often employ <i>project financing </i>in which debt is directly secured by a spe- cific property. Another exception is operating facilities that have been self-constructed as opposed to supplied by a third party. Interest that is attributable to financing the con- struction can be capitalised to make total costs equivalent to a purchased asset. The logic is that interest is no different than other intangibles (e.g. architect and engineering fees) that are imbedded in the asset. Once the project is completed, it will be <i>depreciated </i>over its productive life. Interest capitalisation is appropriate for proper <i>matching </i>in those cases where financing is both substantial and integral to a project’s existence. However, because capitalising interest de-couples the normal relationship between <i>profits </i>and <i>cash flow </i>and creates an intangible asset with uncertain value<i>, </i>it needs to be judiciously used. <i>Financial analysis </i>may often reverse it<i>.</i></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1325.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1327.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
