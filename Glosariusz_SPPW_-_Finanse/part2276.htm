It is issued at a deep discount to its face value (i.e. the </span>present value <span class="p">at market interest rates of the security’s redemption value of principal at maturity). Its return is thus earned through the price appreciation between its discounted price at issuance and its redemption value at maturity. Zero coupon instruments tend to be an anomaly in the market. Investors typically want to see some cash flow returns during the life of their investment. Deferring the payment of returns creates great- er default risk since there are no interest payments as an ongoing “test” of sol- vency and the final repayment burden is magnified. As well, since </span>sensitivity <span class="p">(</span>Fixed Income Asset Price to Interest Rate Changes<span class="p">) is higher the lower the coupon, zero coupon instruments have more price volatility from market interest rate fluc-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tuations. However, the difference between the timing of financing cash flows and their cost can serve several useful purposes. For example, a zero-coupon issuer might be investing proceeds in a project with a long lead time; the interest relief in the meantime might better match the project’s cash flows. From an investor’s perspective, tax motives might favour earning returns via a <i>capital gain </i>(some- times attracting a lower tax rate) versus fully-taxed interest income. Another ben- efit is that there is no <i>reinvestment risk</i>. It is noteworthy that financial reporting under most accounting standards, invoking the <i>substance over form </i>principle, will ignore the timing aspects of zero-coupon securities and accrue financing costs on a periodic basis at the market financing cost at issuance. In effect, accrual ac- counting for interest expense will portray a zero-coupon security as a conven- tional financing instrument that pays its financing costs regularly. The cash flow statement then brings the transaction “full circle”. The <i>indirect method </i>of calculat- ing <i>cash flow from operations </i>adds back the non-cash interest accrual to the net profit figure. We can then see how a zero coupon security completely shifts fi-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="77" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_8064.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2275.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2277.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
