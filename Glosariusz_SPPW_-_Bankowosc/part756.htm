Working within credit policy as a framework, <i>banker’s judgement </i>still has to be exercised since no credit policy can be detailed enough to address every lending situation. Credit policy is the `rules of the game’; the game itself is played by the deci- sions and actions of lending bankers (see quote below). In a decentralised bank, with many sources of originating loans, a credit policy, acting as a boundary for acceptable decisions, is an important source of control and guidance for senior management. However, commercial enterprises besides banks also need a policy when offering trade credit – see <i>credit risk management</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3302.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In any discussion of <b>credit policy</b>, the first question that naturally arises is why have a credit policy at all?
