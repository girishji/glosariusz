Since it can be prone to <i>loan sharking </i>or be a market for sto- len goods, it is often regulated and monitored by the police. The pawn broker, besides being a lender, is also a dealer in goods. He looks entirely at the re- sale value of pledged assets without any real regard to any <i>credit analysis </i>of the “borrower’s” (seller’s) <i>creditworthiness</i>. While they are also in the business of lending, banks are not supposed to act like pawn brokers. Yet when they lend exclusively upon the value of pledged collateral security without regard to <i>debt service capacity </i>or borrower attributes, they are behaving like pawn brokers. Word roots: paun (Old English)/pand (Dut)/Pfand (Ger) = “to pledge”.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2742"><span class="s22">Payday Lending </span></a><span class="s52">(USA) </span><a href="part362.htm#bookmark1230" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Pożyczanie do wypłaty </span><span class="s32">(USA) </span><b>– </b>A consumer lend- ing technique that bridges cash needs until an employee’s payday. In the mean- time, the lender takes a post-dated check as evidence of indebtedness. Pay day lenders lend small amounts ($100–$500) without <i>collateral </i>or even a credit ref- erence. They do require an active checking account and a salaried job. Their “encashment fee” (15–20% of the check’s face value) equates to a very high APR (annual percentage rate) of 300%–500%. Payday lending is controversial be- cause it seems to prey on the desperation of the poor or those disenfranchised from banks. In many American states, it is illegal. That said, a great number of people have an occasional need for “quick cash” (family emergencies etc.) which other credit providers seem unable or unwilling to satisfy. Moreover, many cli-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">ents come from the ranks of the middle class. The abuses on payday lending are not so much in the <i>usury </i>(the APR is largely justified by administration and credit losses) as aggressive collection tactics such as threatening criminal action (in the USA, purposely writing a bad check is illegal) if the check bounces. See also <i>cash loans, debt counselling </i>and <i>home collected credit</i>.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2743"><span class="s22">Pay-down (Loan) </span></a><a href="part577.htm#bookmark1621" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Zmniejszenie salda kredytu </span>– <span class="p">To reduce the outstanding amount of a revolving loan.

A pay-down should be distinguished from a scheduled </span>repayment <span class="p">of a portion of a </span>term loan <span class="p">or fully paying back a loan and permanently extinguishing the liability, sometimes referred to as a “pay- out”. A pay-down should also be contrasted to the advance </span>prepayment <span class="p">of future scheduled repayments. Implicit in the idea of a pay-down of debt is the possibil- ity of further credit usage later on. This is inherent in an </span>asset conversion <span class="p">loan that is financing fluctuating levels of assets. Thus a pay-down is a temporary or transient event during a revolving loan facility’s existence.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="94" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4287.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part977.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part979.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
