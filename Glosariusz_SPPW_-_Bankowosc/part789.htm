In the meantime, monies in the account are held “in trust” (i.e. to be used for a specifically defined pur- pose) pending their ultimate disposition. This, in turn, will impose an enhanced level of fiduciary duty on the bank. Monies should not be paid out unless the bank is absolutely sure that the proper authority is being exercised over the account. This can complicate matters particularly since estates are sometimes shrouded in uncertainty or dispute. For one thing, there is the issue of estab- lishing who is the official trustee and, for another, who has authority over the account (see quote below). The alternative to a trust account is to set up joint accounts when the depositor is alive. The surviving customer (say, a spouse) au- tomatically assumes full ownership after the other dies. As well, P.O.D (paid on death) designations on bank accounts and T.O.D (transfer on death) on broker- age accounts will accomplish the same thing. In some jurisdictions, if an estate is small, banks will allow accounts to be closed by the deceased’s immediate family without court documents based upon proof of death being produced and an indemnity (to protect the bank against wrongly paying out) being given to the bank by recipients of monies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3438.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whether it be upon the banking account or upon trans- fers... actions must be by common assent.
