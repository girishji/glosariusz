Developer/builders use <i>short-term </i>bank credit to complete construction of marketable properties that, upon sale to occupants or long term <i>take-out </i>refi- nancing, promptly <i>retire </i>bank loans. However, the building must be completed to its design specifications (completion risk), property values must hold firm over the construction period (market risk) and enough tenants/purchasers must be found to move in (occupancy risk). The superficial appeal of financing a real estate developer includes land’s firm price (“not making any more of it”), the value creation from transforming raw land to finished structures and the unassailable strength of <i>mortgage </i>collateral. The dangers include the long time period between “breaking ground” and completion in which economic, social</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">and demographic conditions can change. Part of the risk comes from the fi- nancing activity itself. Real estate values tend to be cyclical; bank lending itself can fuel this cyclicality by artificially boosting demand. When bankers with- draw credit from the market, values collapse in a market of inelastic supply. While there are sound principles to real estate lending which make it a prudent activity, banks which compromise their <i>credit standards </i>by lending aggressively in heated markets that then cool down can suffer losses. Real estate financing also involves <i>long term </i>lenders who will finance the ownership and operation of the property. Debt service comes from rentals, net of operating expenses and taxes. Term to maturity usually matches the life of the asset and can extend up to 30 years. These <i>take out </i>loans are often contributed to pools and securitized, off-loading much of the risk to other investors in <i>mortgage backed securities. </i>See also <i>Property Value at Risk </i>(<i>PVAR</i>).</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 72%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5172">Real Estate Investment Trusts </a><span class="s22">• </span>REITS <a href="part225.htm#bookmark575" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part225.htm#bookmark575" class="s23">Fundusze powiernicze inwe- </a><span class="s33">stujące w nieruchomości </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">A publicly traded investment fund that holds</span><a name="bookmark5173">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">real-estate properties, typically income generating commercial buildings or residential apartments. Subject to qualifying under the law, they can be classi- fied as “trusts” (i.e. assets that are being held on behalf of others). REITS thereby escape direct taxation if they distribute most (say 90%) of their free cash flow through to private investors who, in turn, may be able to shelter the taxable in- come if they have tax deductions. This feature attracts more investors and al- lows REITS to be more liquid than most property funds. REITS also allow in- dustrial companies and institutional investors (such as <i>insurance companies</i>) to unlock the value of real estate that would otherwise have to be held on the books for long periods of time (e.g. 25–50 years for the life of most buildings).
