The connotation of “poisonous” comes because they can infect otherwise healthy balance sheets causing “death” (i.e. insolvency). Toxic assets are most often associated with the <i>collateralized debt obligations </i>that were used to securitize <i>sub-prime </i>mort- gages during the lead up to the <i>Credit Crisis of 2007–2009</i>. Mortgage market conditions first deteriorated in the USA with a sharp rise in default rates and foreclosures. Surprisingly, given their undoubted credit ratings, even the sup- posedly safe tranches of CDOs showed signs of value impairment. In the meantime, the secondary market for CDOs was restricted (because of regula-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tions, CDO holdings were largely confined to banks and other financial insti- tutions). If a desperate bank tried to shed itself of toxic assets, there were few, if any, buyers. Those toxic assets that did sell went at a very deep discount. In a <i>flight to quality </i>in which no one would touch anything remotely risky, market prices went into a self-perpetuating freefall. However, there was more bad news. Because of fair value accounting rules, the carrying value of toxic assets was not immune to market prices. Follow-on write-downs caused even more losses even if toxic assets were not for sale. Fear about those banks stuck with toxic assets was great enough that inter-bank credit markets ceased to function at the height of the crisis. It is quite possible that toxic assets have intrinsic values that are much higher than their balance sheet carrying amount at fair value. However, in the absence of a liquid market (which the <i>Troubled Asset Relief Program </i>(TARP) seeks to alleviate) banks can only wait for more favour- able market conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="86" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7826.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2180.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2182.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
