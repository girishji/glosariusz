Today, it is one of the largest sources of <i>insurance </i>and reinsurance underwriting with a particular aptitude in insuring specialised risks (e.g. you can insure a ballerina’s legs). Lloyd’s has a rich history. In the past, the market was composed of individual wealthy investors (so-called “names”) who were prepared to pledge their personal assets in support of syn- dicates that jointly underwrote insurance risks. In the face substantial payouts for claims, most participants these days are large, incorporated entities. It is not to be confused with Lloyds TSB Bank, a British <i>clearer </i>with no connection to the insurance entity.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4543">Load-to-Load (Payment Terms) </a><a href="part608.htm#bookmark1560" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Płatność przy następnej dostawie </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">Open </span><span class="p">credit terms of payment arrangement whereby a receiving buyer pays for the last delivery when the next one is received.

For exam- ple, in the case of an <i>initial public offering</i>, employees of the issuer holding shares may not sell since it could be a signal to the market of bearish expectations by insiders. Lock up periods generally last less than a year. Another less common type of lock up occurs when a fund’s assets are temporarily frozen.
