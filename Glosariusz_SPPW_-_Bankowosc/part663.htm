Bismarck was his most powerful connection. Many Bleichröder loans were secretly arranged to wage wars, influence the press or procure the co-operation of politicians. These rather unsavoury uses could not have been openly financed out of gov- ernment budgets since legislative approval would entail political debate (see quote below). Bleichröder life demonstrated the intimate and at times sinis- ter nexus between banking and political authority in the days of crony capital- ism. Financial factors had an influence on the policies of 19<span class="s342">th </span>century statesmen while reciprocal favours from the state were often valued in banking (Bleich- röder was one of the few Jews in Prussia to be ennobled). There is a bitter irony at work in Bleichröder helping to build a nation that would subsequently do such harm against his people. While the German family bank has disappeared, Bleichröder’s descendents continue to operate on Wall Street (the high-profile investor George Soros once worked for them).

In effect, the customer relinquishes control over the destiny of fi- nancial assets, although formal legal ownership continues to reside with the debtor. This is useful in high-risk situations where a bank must keep a diligent eye on cus- tomer activity. In addition, blocked accounts are a reliable form of collateral secu- rity, especially where there is an expectation of the need for a future payment (e.g. in the case of an outstanding <i>documentary letter of credit</i>). Finally, a legally sanctioned order by a court of law, tax or policing authorities can block an account.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1859"><span class="s22">Bond vs. Bank Debt </span></a><a href="part280.htm#bookmark1086" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Obligacja a zadłużenie w banku </span>– A bond is a fixed in- terest rate term debt (see the <i>Compendium of Finance </i>for more discussions).

In efficient markets, bond trading will continuously re-value the credit risk of such debts in the mark-to-market process. This ‘feedback’ loop contrasts with a bank’s hold-to-maturity approach, which has no external and objective reference for fair value. Because banks have to match deposits, the maturity on bank loans is often shorter (vs. bonds of, say, 5–15 years) and interest is floating<i>. </i>Enterprises without a public credit rating tend to borrow from banks (see <i>small business lend- ing</i>). Banks can accept their credit risk based on an ongoing relationship which allows them to <i>know the borrower</i>, <i>credit analysis </i>and possibly be protected by <i>collateral security. </i>The more impersonal, discriminating and less informed capital market is less able to cope with the <i>asymmetric information problem </i>when bor- rowers do not have a credit rating. Another distinction between bonds and bank debt occurs in cases of <i>financial distress</i>: it is usually more difficult to reschedule, restructure or forgive bonds held in the hands of so many diverse and anonymous owners. The trend of bailing in is changing this. Finally, investors in bonds do not play the same pro-active role in the ongoing monitoring and control of borrowers the way banks do. Banks thus bring more <i>financial discipline </i>into play on their borrowers. The growing capacity of capital markets to accept credit risk is making inroads on traditional bank credit – see <i>disintermediation</i>. In all, banks and bond markets serve different purposes, each capitalising on their advantages. A healthy competition in allowing firms <i>access to capital </i>through the choice of bonds or bank debt makes for more efficient markets (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2904.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Electronic Herd [i.e. global capital investors] has long en- couraged the creation of <b>bond markets</b>, both for its own ap- petites and because of how well-regulated bond and stock markets contribute to greater financial democratization and transparency.
