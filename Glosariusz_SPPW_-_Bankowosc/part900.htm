They are also often in the midst of a complex, transitional period such as a merger and acquisition or recapitalisation etc. (Note: lending to small businesses without a credit rating is not considered “leveraged lending”; rather this is the <i>SME </i>mar- ket segment.) From a borrower’s perspective, high leverage may be necessitated by expediency (say, a management buy-out). Or, the firm may be in the midst of restructuring itself. (If the high leverage is the result of a bank’s own customer getting into trouble, the lending process is known as a <i>recovery workout.</i>) While lenders usually shun excessive leverage because it raises default risk, they may</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">rationalise it as a temporary <i>bridge </i>(see <i>highly leveraged transactions</i>) or they may simply be attracted to the high yields they can earn by working in concert with private equity financing (see graph below left). Typically, specialised units within a bank will handle the extra complexities involved in leveraged lend- ing. In the 1980s, junk bonds were a common source of such debts. Leveraged loans became more popular because they could be quicker to arrange and they allowed lenders to have tighter controls over the borrower through the enforce- ment of restrictive <i>covenants</i>. Alas, an excessive zeal for private equity buy-outs in 2005–2007 caused many banks to over-lend and then suddenly retrench (see graph below right). The subsequent write-downs of non-performing bank-fi- nanced leveraged buy-outs were over $40 billion (“The Economist”, 21/8/10,</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">p. 10). They were a contributing factor in the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009.
