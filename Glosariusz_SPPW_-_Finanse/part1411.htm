To avoid depressing market prices upon such sales, owners with large holdings commonly dispose of <i>blocks </i>by selling them to an investment bank that in turn will “trickle” them into the market. Stock exchanges will normally allow a temporary delay in disclosing this type of market “overhang” in order to protect the identity of the forced sellers of the stock. This is meant to prevent any temporary excess supply from unduly depressing share price. In specifying a delay period, stock exchange rules try to seek a balance between transparency and liquidity.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark3673">Deleveraging </a><a href="part130.htm#bookmark330" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part130.htm#bookmark330" class="s23">Delewarowanie (obniżenie poziomu dźwigni finansowej)</a></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s22">• </span>Reducing excessive and dangerous amounts of borrower <i>debt </i>typically in re-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">sponse to adverse market conditions. While <i>leverage </i>has its attractions, it is not without risk. If you are a business, you might deleverage by raising equity capital and paying down debt. Alternatively, a business might sell assets and apply the proceeds to debt, although this will not reduce leverage ratios as quickly as pay- downs from new equity. As well, it may be expensive if asset prices are unfavour- able. Deleveraging can also be achieved by economizing on operations and ap- plying extra free cash flow to debt repayment. Households typically deleverage by reducing consumption and increasing savings. Deleveraging is an adjustment process that is often painful. The transition to more sustainable levels of debt re- quires sacrifices. In the <i>Credit Crisis of 2007–2009</i>, the deleveraging process re- duced aggregate demand and forestalled any quick economic recovery.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3674"><span class="s21">Delist </span></a><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s21">Deregister </span><a href="part1041.htm#bookmark2707" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Wyrejestrowanie </span><span class="s22">• </span>Withdrawing securities from a rela- tively minor public <i>dual-listing </i>as part of an effort to economize on compliance costs such as regulatory filings, <i>annual reports</i>, etc. For example, a European firm with a float of less than 5% of its outstanding shares in the USA (a regula- tory threshold) might be allowed to delist on the basis that a “home regulator” was attending to the company’s oversight.
