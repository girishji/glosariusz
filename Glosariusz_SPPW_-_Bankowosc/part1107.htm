Only the most <i>undoubted </i>insti- tutions would be immune. Defaults could migrate through clearing and settle- ment activities or in the inter-bank market. The resulting <i>panic </i>would cause a <i>meltdown </i>that could damage other economic sectors in a vicious circle from the self-magnifying knock on effects of <i>contagion</i>. Even without connectedness, the <i>asymmetric information problem </i>can perpetuate fears. Since nobody can quite be sure how exposed others are, everybody is suspect. During the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, fears about who was “stuck” with toxic assets lead to <i>frozen credit markets</i>. The power of systemic risk was dramatically demonstrated in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4847.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">2008 by Lehman Brothers bank. The failure of a relatively small New York bank sent ripples throughout global markets. Traditional defences against systemic risks include such confidence-building mechanisms as a <i>lender of last resort</i>, deposit insurance and the <i>too-big-to-fail doctrine. </i>In today’s world, these are not enough. Accordingly, one of the <i>post-credit crisis responses </i>has been to identify large <i>systematically important financial institutions </i>(see quote below) and re- quire that they have more capital and liquidity than normal. Not to be confused with systematic risk or “undiversified” risk reflected in the beta factor of the capital asset pricing model (see the <i>Compendium of Finance</i>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4848.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">[Globalisation] creates <b>inter-locking </b>fragility, while re- ducing volatility and giving the appearance of stability...
