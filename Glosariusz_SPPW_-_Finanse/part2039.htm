Simply divide 72 by the interest rate (to be precise the rate in decimal terms times one hundred; i.e. 8% = .08 x 100 = “8”). For example, an investment grow- ing at a rate of 8% per annum could be expected to double in value in approxi- mately [72/8 = 9] nine years.

Rumours come in many guises. Some rumours start from hard facts and morph into something else through their repeated telling. Some ru- mours are informed speculation that will prove both prescient and profitable for those that bet on them. Some rumours are entirely made up to purposely jolt the market (see <i>pump and dump</i>). Typically rumours are ignored by long term investors or offset by a counter-rumour. Companies will often make public statements to clarify matters and thereby quash any misinformation. Deliber- ately spreading a false rumour is a form of stock market manipulation and is illegal in most countries although it can be difficult to prove.

In the case of financial institutions that operate on confidence, adverse rumours in the midst of a <i>financial crisis </i>can be particularly damaging. Even the existence of a rumour and its subsequent de- nial can make shareholders jittery. For example, in 2008, the shares of a large UK bank, HBOS, fell by 17% in one day based on a false rumour that the bank was short of cash (reference: Financial Times”, <i>Muzzle the market manipulators</i>, March 22, 2008, p. 6).
