The IMF’s country reports are akin to ‘report cards’ that bring a healthy <i>financial discipline </i>to bear on nation-states (see quote below). This ‘feedback loop’ mechanism al- lows impersonal global capital markets to influence a country’s internal eco- nomic policies through credit ratings and credit pricing. The IMF considers its country reports to be powerful tools in averting the financial crises that spur IMF intervention (which seldom proves to be easy or popular amongst recipi- ents). In the words of one of IMF’s former directors: “The only real strength of the IMF is the ruthlessness of truth telling.” [“International Herald Tribune”, 12/5/10, p. 17]. Indeed, as Keynes once said at the Bretton Woods conference in 1945 (when the IMF was founded), “When you are true, people listen to you.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3214.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of the most important things the <b>IMF </b>could do today would be to work with countries to ensure that they publish in a timely way and credible fashion much more detailed ver- sions of their overall balance sheets – including the govern- ment’s outstanding foreign currency obligations and the size and maturity of the private sector’s foreign borrowings.

While the role of cov- enants traditionally is to give lenders an opportunity to react before disaster strikes, most borrowers will resist the loss of flexibility and will try to negotiate them down or even out. Covenant-lite (a play on words referring to less harm- ful low alcohol drinks or low nicotine cigarettes) loans are typically offered by design by <i>aggressive lenders </i>seeking higher returns in return for higher risks. What is more, in competitive credit markets, borrowers often have the upper hand in negotiations.
