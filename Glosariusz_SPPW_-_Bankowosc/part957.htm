Negotiable instruments include <i>banknotes</i>, <i>cheques </i>(checks), <i>bills of exchange </i>and <i>promissory notes</i>. Because they can be passed along from one party to another they are crucial in facilitating money-based exchange and thus move beyond the constraints of barter trade. To be “nego- tiable”, a financial instrument must typically have the following characteristics:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">title passes by delivery</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">holder may sue in his own name</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">no notice of assignment needs to be given</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">the holder takes the instrument in good faith without notice of defects.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4201.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Some important legal principles include “holder in due course” whereby a third party to the original transaction can receive value from the original maker of an obligation. Another fundamental and useful concept is endorsement whereby a third party can confirm their status as holder in due course, pass title to the bill to another party and guarantee the original obligation. The evolutionary development of such laws was an important milestone in the institutional infra- structure needed to nourish banking (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4202.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of the most powerful influences on human activity is the driving force of trade.
