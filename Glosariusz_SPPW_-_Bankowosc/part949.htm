For example, the permanent exposure of a margined revolving line of credit to finance receivables could be akin to a dangerous ‘quasi-equity’. Howev- er, because it is subject to ongoing monitoring and control, exposure can always be covered by liquid assets. Credit can be restricted or withdrawn by exercising the <i>on demand </i>tenor. It is thus a “liquid” loan exposure despite never necessar- ily repaying. But this is the case only if there is a robust monitoring and control function in place. There are three challenges in monitoring. First, there must be reporting systems that automatically deliver timely information to the banker. Second, is the ability to recognise potential problems (see <i>red flags/warning sig- nals</i>) whilst all the while staying relaxed about normal events (to avoid control fatigue). Third, there is the psychological tendency to be complacent and not take action. When things seem to be going well, it is difficult to be vigilant and easy to passively drift along (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4154.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Image the lookout on the Titanic being asked to look for icebergs and, when questioned why no warning was given, replying that his job was to look out – not report what he saw.

The precedent created by a lender’s forbearance in cases of true financial distress may thus tempt otherwise healthy but “inconvenienced” bor- rowers to plead for the same treatment (see <i>won’t pay or can’t pay</i>). An exam- ple known to your author could be the government/bank rescue in the 1980’s of Canada’s Dome Petroleum, a multi-billion dollar distressed borrower. The Dome problem happened to coincide with widespread difficulties in the agri- cultural sector. Many farmers, resorting to civil disobedience to resist bailiffs, argued that their loans should be treated in the same manner as a large corpo- rate borrower. This is one reason why the banker’s instinct is to enforce their <i>creditor’s rights </i>and insist upon <i>repayment </i>even when <i>forbearance </i>and even debt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="157" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4156.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part948.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part950.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
