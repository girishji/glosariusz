The term – which is a variation of <i>bail-out </i>– is most commonly applied to <i>sovereign </i>debtors from emerging markets. Because it is impractical to get <i>bond </i>holder’s concurrence, they were traditionally ex- empted from requests to restructure their debt. Initiating rescues were left to governments, international agencies (such as the International Monetary Fund) or institutional lenders such as international commercial banks. However, by allowing cash to continue to escape for certain repayments, any new money was indirectly benefiting those creditors who did nothing. This raised concerns about <i>moral hazard, </i>particularly from government rescuers who were under political pressure not to squander tax payers’ money. In a bail-in, private sec-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tor lenders will be compelled (coerced?) to reschedule their loans or keep open lines of credit as a condition to a country’s rescue package.
