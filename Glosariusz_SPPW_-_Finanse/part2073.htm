The logic is quite compelling. If the in- vestor’s fears prove wrong, the cost of prematurely selling is negligible since you can always buy back into the market having lost only transaction costs of exit and re-entry. However, if fears prove to be correct, you’ve saved yourself from a cash loss. Going the other way, if you buy into the market on a speculative ru- mour that proves wrong, you will suffer a real loss that cannot be recouped. If the rumour was in fact correct, you should have bought. However, your only loss is an <i>opportunity cost </i>of forgone profit which is easier to bear than the cash cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5411"><span class="s21">Sell-side of the Market </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part823.htm#bookmark2119" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Strona podażowa rynku </span><span class="s48">(żargon) </span><span class="s22">• </span>A broad classification of existing investors in the <i>capital market </i>who are in a selling mode. This gives them certain biases and needs. Since they know the investment by virtue of having owned it, they are less interested in information about it (i.e. there is no <i>asymmetric information problem</i>). They have already made up their mind to sell and are keen to have liquid markets with lots of po- tential investors on the <i>buy-side. </i>Their orientation is as <i>traders </i>versus <i>buy and hold </i>investors. They are also relatively more interested in timing as opposed to a <i>buy and hold </i>investment strategy.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sensitivity (Bond Price) <a href="part1218.htm#bookmark3170" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">▶ </a><a href="part1218.htm#bookmark3170" class="s382">Bond </a><span class="s24">Sensitivity.</span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5412">Sensitivity (Fixed Income Asset Price to Interest Rate Changes) </a><a href="part965.htm#bookmark2502" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part965.htm#bookmark2502" class="s23">Wrażliwość (ceny aktywów o stałym oprocentowaniu na zmiany </a><span class="s33">oprocentowania) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">The percentage variation in the price of a fixed interest</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">rate security (e.g. bond) in response to a variation in market interest rates. Be- cause of <i>yield arbitrage</i>, financial assets will vary inversely to interest rate move- ments in order that <i>yields-to-maturity </i>are equivalent to market rates. For exam- ple, let’s say that it has been determined by a mathematical formula that a bond has a sensitivity of, say, 6.42. If market interest rates rise by .50% (e.g. 50 basis points) from 5.21% to 5.71%, the price of the bond will fall by 6.42 x .50% = 3.21%. Sensitivity varies with the maturity of the bond (longer = more sensi- tive), the level of its coupons (smaller = more sensitive) and the level of interest rates (lower = more sensitive), <i>zero coupon bonds </i>being the most sensitive. The calculation of <i>duration </i>captures coupon rate and maturity in one measure. The sensitivity of investments can be the basis for proactive portfolio trading (vs. holding until maturity) based on interest rate speculation. Expecting interest rates to fall? Then buy 30 year zero coupon bonds which will be the most sensi- tive to the interest rate drop and which will go up in price the most.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="117" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7363.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2072.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2074.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
