For example, an ‘out of the blue’ lawsuit for product liability sud- denly occurs. Will the company lose? How much will it cost if they do? Will other lawsuits follow? Most importantly, how much will <i>shareholder value </i>suf- fer? The key is not so much the problem itself (which usually cannot be hidden in any event) but rather in quantifying the extent and implications of the prob- lem. The company’s credibility is tested. Is the company telling all? Or is it try- ing to cover up and put a positive spin on bad news? Stock markets often tend to assume the worse and then bounce back after their initial scepticism proves to be excessive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For any kind of <span class="s30">crisis management</span>, there were three “A”s – <span class="s30">a</span>cknowledge, <span class="s30">a</span>pologize, and <span class="s30">a</span>ct.
