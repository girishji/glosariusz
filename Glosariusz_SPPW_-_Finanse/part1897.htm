It might be offered by companies with good growth prospects but limited assets and a short operating history (see <i>Al- ternative Investment Market</i>). Trading volumes tend to be limited to <i>over-the- counter </i>transactions with high (e.g. +10%) bid-offer spreads. As well, such stocks are often outside the scope of regulatory disclosure requirements. While penny stocks may have some legitimacy, their cheap price ($1,000 buys a lot of shares) – and high upside (a 5 cent rise on a 10 cent stock is a 50% return) – of- ten makes them attractive to naïve or greedy investors looking for a quick and easy profit. All of these forces conspire to make penny stocks highly speculative and volatile. Even worse, penny stocks are often utilised in frauds such as “pump and dump” schemes, these days often using the internet. Another way penny stocks arise is from the financial distress of previously sound companies (see <i>fallen angel</i>). If a stock falls below a dollar, it usually passes a psychological tip- ping point.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4948"><span class="s21">Pension </span></a><a href="part175.htm#bookmark448" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Emerytura </span><span class="s22">• </span>An <i>annuity </i>paid to finance living costs during a person’s retirement years. The money may come from the government (the so-called welfare state’s social security safety net), one’s employer or through private sav- ings (see <i>pension funds</i>). Depending upon the gap between retirement (say age 60–65) and life expectancy (say, 75–85 yrs), as well as lifestyle, a pension will consume a large portion of a worker’s life-time earnings. That said, life-cycle consumption patterns usually mean that one’s needs in the “sunset years” can be relatively modest, although health care costs in old age can be expensive. A combination of increases in life expectancy and the fiscal constraints of govern- ment pensions make the need to build a nest egg an important planning issue in <i>personal finances </i>for most people.
