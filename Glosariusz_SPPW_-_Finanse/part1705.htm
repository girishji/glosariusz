A less negative connotation comes from calling them <i>high-yield bonds</i>. Their higher-than-normal chance of default (say, 5–15% of such bonds might be expected to default) gives them an una- bashedly <i>speculative </i>nature. Hence they may also be referred to as “non-in- vestment grade” bonds or “speculative grade” bonds. Compared to Europe and Asia, the USA has the most active market for junk bonds. This allows America’s capital market to be all the more robust and better able to accept risk. Apart from the depth of the market, one reason for US predominance is their bankruptcy laws that are more conducive to asserting creditor’s rights in the event that bonds do default. Junk bonds have two risks: interest rate and</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">default on principal. Who would invest in them?

Traditionally, junk bonds were <i>fallen angels </i>– <i>blue chip </i>companies with lost credit ratings that had fallen on hard times. The <i>financial innovation </i>of junk bonds, which was largely attributable to a Mr. <i>Michael Milken</i>, was their first-time issuance as substandard risks. Prior to junk bonds, weak borrowers without a good rating were denied access to <i>capital markets. </i>They could at best resort to bank credit. However, for many, borrowing was difficult or impossible. Their his- torical <i>performance </i>record, the bankers’ innate conservatism or modest bank interest rates (most lenders reach a point where credit standards cannot be compromised by higher interest) combined to work against them. Yet these borrowers deserved credit if it could be properly priced. Junk bonds empha- sised that substandard debt could be a tradable asset whose value rested more on future performance. The trading of junk bonds in turn allowed <i>mark-to- market </i>valuation and filled a gap in the spectrum of available <i>risk-reward trade offs</i>. The speculative opportunities offered by junk bonds attracted large pools of capital and seemed to be a harbinger of <i>finance capitalism. </i>In 1998, their annual issuance volume peaked at $150 billion per year. However, too much of a good thing led to excesses and the market went into a deep, but as it turned out temporary, retreat. Junk bonds have the enduring financial merit of channelling risk capital to worthy, if not strong, users – small new compa- nies and old companies trying to fix problems – previously denied credit. For example, they can be useful in financing the spin-offs of divested assets in corporate restructuring. By supplementing bank loans, junk bonds are also part of the <i>securitization </i>and disintermediation process. Since junk bonds permit high <i>leverage</i>, they were popular in <i>hostile take-overs </i>or <i>management buyout. </i>This, in turn, stimulated new demands – and rich fees – for the advi- sory services of Wall Street <i>investment banks</i>. Finally, junk bonds had a deep- er impact on the American economy by being a catalyst in much of America’s <i>corporate restructuring </i>in 1980s. The resulting salutary effect on corporate performance lead to a sustained period of prosperity in the 1990s that was so intense that it has been called a <i>New Paradigm</i>. Contrast with distressed debt that is already in default.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="240" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_6055.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1704.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1706.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
