Informally known as “belt tightening” to symbolise going on a weight-loss diet. Austerity is hopefully a temporary sacrifice in order to return to permanently sustainable debt levels (“getting into shape”). As a correction of a previous binge period of “living beyond our means”, there is a certain symmetry and sense of propitiation for past sins. In body building parlance: “No pain, no gain”. The term is usually applied to whole economies. Excessive private sector debt can only be reduced in so many ways. The hard way is to come up with the cash for repayment. But another way is by default (shifting sacrifices to creditors), higher real incomes (so debt is a smaller portion of income) and inflation (to erode the burden of debt</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">in real purchasing power). Austerity is a policy choice to permit repayment. For governments, this means deficit-cutting, lower spending, and a reduction in the amount of benefits and public services provided. Taxes may also be increased to reduce debt. Politically, such austerity is inevitably difficult and even socially disruptive when there is civil unrest.
