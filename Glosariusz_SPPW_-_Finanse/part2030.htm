The <i>capital asset pricing model </i>argues that, in <i>efficient capital markets</i>, company-specific risk disappears with diversification in a <i>port- folio</i>. Therefore, a firm’s specific risk taking (in its markets or products) is less important than its earnings volatility, as measured by its “beta”, relative to the stock market. Risk adjusted cost of capital is meaningful within <i>small and me- dium enterprises </i>whose shares are not traded in a market. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists typically demand high returns. In addition, lenders charge higher interest to compensate for credit risk and the higher costs of adminis- trating small loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 72%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark5303"><span class="s21">Risk Appetite </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part810.htm#bookmark2088" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a>Stopień akceptacji ryzyka <span class="s48">(żargon) </span><a href="part810.htm#bookmark2089" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part810.htm#bookmark2089" class="s23">Skłon- </a>ność do ryzyka <span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">The degree of desire to accept </span><span class="s25">risk </span><span class="p">in a commercial transac-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tion. It could also be called “risk capacity” or perhaps “risk tolerance”. Risk ap- petite will be a function of several things. The decision maker’s attitude to risk is important. Most of us won’t take any chances unless we have to. Another consideration is <i>diversification</i>, especially in terms of the size of the transaction’s downside compared to the financial resources at hand. Smaller businesses can- not afford to gamble and lose as much as big corporations. (This is perhaps one reason for the saying: “The rich get richer and the poor get poorer”). A view on future business conditions will certainly have a bearing (for instance, if we think a <i>recession </i>is looming, extra caution will be exercised). Finally, the <i>risk-reward trade-off </i>will govern much of risk appetite. We can readily see this in the case of selling on <i>trade credit. </i>Risk appetite will typically be determined by selling mar- gins. A risk neutral seller would balance the benefits of taking risk against the costs and weight them by expected probability. Thus the expected benefits could be quantified as: <i>gross profit </i>x probability of payment (= reciprocal of the prob- ability of default). The expected costs would be losses x probability of default. A threshold situation would be where expected benefits just equal expected costs: Cost x P% = (Price – cost) x (1-P%). Solving algebraically, this will occur when the <i>gross profit margin </i>equals probability of default. Thus, the higher the gross profit margin, the more trade credit risk can be assumed. In the case of repeat orders, even more risk can be assumed since a priori probability of default will tend to fall as a track record of successful payments is built up over time. Ad- ditionally, repeat orders build up customer loyalty and offer more profit op- portunities. Assuming suppliers are earning margins of, say, 10%-30%, trade credit should be <i>spontaneously </i>forthcoming. Inability to obtain trade credit is thus a bad sign (unless the buyer is taking <i>early payment discounts</i>). In the same way, other financial decision makers will respond to risk accordingly. For exam- ple, with their lending margins of 1–2%, <i>commercial banks </i>will strive to be very</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="69" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7242.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2029.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2031.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
