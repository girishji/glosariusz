Shares are usually purchased in the open market (to avoid <i>dilution</i>) and held in a <i>trust fund </i>until employees qualify (either by job performance or by tenure) to receive them. The employer may also subsidise the share purchases or the administration of a trust. If the trust is truly independent of the employer, it should exist outside the employ- er’s financial statements. However, to the extent that the employer controls the trust, the <i>substance over form </i>principle would dictate that the trust’s assets and liabilities be carried in the balance sheet and the recurring costs of the ESOP be expensed as part of employee costs.

Enron’s dramatic fall played like Greek tragedy where hubris (a popular Enron book is titled “The Smartest Guys in the Room”), greed and ambition combined into a “conspiracy of fools”. The account- ing culprits were undisclosed <i>off-balance sheet </i>liabilities (see <i>off-the-books partnerships</i>), aggressive, even <i>fraud</i>ulent, <i>earnings management</i>, weak <i>internal controls </i>and ineffective <i>corporate governance, </i>all of which seemed to implicate culpability by the company’s <i>audi- tors</i>. As well, it transpired that Enron’s bankers facilitated the ruse by providing $9 bil- lion in financing that, using complicated <i>smoke and mirrors </i>“prepay” transactions, made debt look like operating income. Ironically, given its normally conservative bent, Enron even managed to abuse <i>mark-to-market </i>accounting by recognising income prematurely. Enron was an unprecedented <i>Wall Street scandal </i><a href="http://www.enronmovie.com/" class="s24" target="_blank">expected to have widespread and endur- ing fall out. In 2006, its executives were in court; a movie has been made about it (see </a><span style=" color: #1922FB;">www.enronmovie.com</span>). The name has become a byword for all that was wrong with cor- porate America at the turn of the century (even leading to a new word “enron”, as in to be cheated). Prior to its demise, Enron was a paragon of dynamism (a “<i>New Economy </i>pow- erhouse” in the words of one study). Its downfall made fools of many who fell for Enron’s well-crafted hype and who got caught up in the naive <i>herd </i>instinct of followers. In the absence of any forewarning, a natural cry was: “Where were the auditors?!” The auditor may indeed have been <i>negligent </i>professionally in being so easily duped (Enron was notori- ously complex). More damning, however, is that Arthur <i>Andersen’s </i>lucrative <i>management</i></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1565.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1567.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
