Common income trust assets are in commercial real estate and natural resources. To set up a trust, operating enterprises will sell a “stand-alone” group of assets to a trust. There- after, the assets are administered (for a fee) by the enterprise that previously owned them. Once in place, such assets usually generate steady cash flow with- out the need for large reinvestment beyond some modest maintenance expen- ditures. Absent any reinvestment opportunities, most tax regimes require that the trust’s free cash flow be distributed to investors. This offers them the attrac- tion of constant and reliable cash flows. Depending upon the tax regime, this can also be done on a tax efficient basis by waiving any taxation of the trust it-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">self thereby avoiding double taxation.

This should especially be the case in the <i>prospectuses </i>for <i>ini- tial public offerings </i>where the capital markets are unfamiliar with the company. However, the investment bankers may argue that they are relying on representa- tions from the issuer and deserve to be protected if the companies hoodwink them.

Absent any partialities, such directors are better placed to represent the interests of <i>shareholders</i>, especially in those instances where there is not a com- plete mutuality of interests with management (e.g. in setting compensation and assessing performance). Traditionally, an outside director was somebody with a public high-profile whose stature would be sufficient not to be compromised by commercial interests. It tended to be more an honorary than executive func- tion. They were usually recruited from the ranks of retired executives who were often card carrying members of an Old Boy Network. Board meetings were no more than an opportunity to smooze over a good lunch. Remuneration was modest, but so were the responsibilities as a member of a rubber-stamping body. Lacking information and many seats at the table, outside directors felt like pampered guests. It would be rude to challenge the host. However, with the growing emphasis on better <i>corporate governance</i>, outside directors are becom- ing more important and assertive. They are increasing in numbers (in the USA, almost 80% of boards in 2000 were independent outsiders). More importantly, they are expected to have real teeth and vigorously promote <i>shareholder rights</i>, if needed by openly questioning executive management’s judgment and track record. With greater responsibilities, independent/outside directors need to be paid more and have greater financial stakes in the companies they oversee.
