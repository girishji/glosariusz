The term tends to convey negative connotations. Cutting prices is a legitimate strategy when a firm has either operating leverage or economies of scale where costs will fall with volume increases in turn, allowing a virtuous cycle of lower costs and lower prices (e.g. Henry Ford’s business model). Oth- erwise, buying market share tends to infer a desperate measure that emphasises sales volumes at the expense of profitability. Banks can see such behaviour when they have borrowers who are <i>over-trading</i>. Indeed, they can be prone to buying market share themselves whenever banks engage in <i>aggressive lending</i>.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part672.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part674.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
