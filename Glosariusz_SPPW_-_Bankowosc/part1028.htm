Initially, the backtracking was in response to performance problems, and in many cases outright <i>default</i>, in the banking system identified as the secular change argument. The term was most commonly used in the USA where a rash of bank failures (the “savings and loans crisis”) in the 1980s prompted authorities to reverse their initial embrace of <i>liber- alisation</i>. World-wide, the idea of re-regulation was evolving into a “loose-tight” (a.k.a. “light touch” regulation) framework whereby banks were allowed to act as uninhibited competitive players but were subject to compliance to harmonised rules (Basel I &amp; II) regarding risk management. After the confidence-shaking trau- ma of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 the re-regulation movement has taken on new urgency and resolve (see quote below). Bolder regulators are now demanding higher capital requirements and tighter restrictions on risk-taking. They are even going so far as to tackle the moral hazard inherent in the <i>too-big-to-fail doctrine </i>by either encouraging banks to shrink or finding ways to let them fail harmless- ly without jeopardising others. The challenge with re-regulation is not throwing out the proverbial “baby with the bath water”. Robust, competitive and unfettered banks produce growth, generate wealth and enrich people’s lives. Financial mar- kets are wise but not infallible, but they learn from their mistakes. Another chal- lenge is humility. The vested interests of bank owners can exercise insider <i>oversight </i>through <i>corporate governance </i>mechanisms. Consequently, rigid and externally im- posed regulations may have limited capacity to make banking systems truly safe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="421" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4492.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The near-collapse of the world’s banking system two-and-a-</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">-half years ago has prompted a fundamental reassessment of the industry.
