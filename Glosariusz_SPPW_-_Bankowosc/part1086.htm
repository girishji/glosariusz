Be- cause true sovereignty is a supreme and independent power, it can be said that a “sovereign loan is a loan repayable at the option of the borrower”. Like any borrower, governments tend to default when they are over-extended. A debt-to- GDP ratio of 100% and budget deficits greater than 10% of GNP are considered rough default “thresholds”. That said, historically countries have defaulted not as a strategy to get out of heavy debts but rather as a desperate bid to buy time in the midst of a re-financing crisis. Sovereign defaults damage national pride, reputation and future creditworthiness. They also lead to a sharp decline in ex- ternal credit to private companies in the defaulting country. Even the innocent can suffer. For instance, in the aftermath of the 1980s debt crisis when Mexico</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4759.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">defaulted, credit to developing countries as a whole (including non-defaulters) dried up. Consider what happened to Argentina. In 2001 it defaulted on $82 bil- lion of sovereign debt, after months of turmoil in the country’s banking system. That led to the abandonment of its exchange-rate regime and a sharp devalua- tion of the peso; argentina’s GDP plummeted by more than 10% that year. It was locked out of international capital markets for many years. (Another example could have been Greece were it not for its EU rescue). Yet despite the sanctions against default, governments default all the time (see graph below). The reason is often political expediency since the necessary “fix” (e.g. increases in taxes, reduced government expenditures etc.) usually involves imposing hardship on the general populace. With time and the intervention of such supra-national powers as the International Monetary Fund, the remedy is a debt rescheduling or restructuring (in which lenders may be forced to take a <i>haircut</i>). In a famous utterance, Citibank’s head once proclaimed that, “countries can’t go bankrupt”. While he subjected himself to derision, he was actually right. Wriston meant that countries cannot disappear or be liquidated; not that they wouldn’t de- fault. The permanence of their existence nonetheless does not eliminate the risk of loss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4760.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It seems a truism to say that no lender to a country can be safe unless he knows something about that country.
