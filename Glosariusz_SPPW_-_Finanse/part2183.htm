Also known as “letter stock” or “targeted stock”. Tracking stocks are either distributed to parent company shareholders or take the form of an <i>initial public offering</i>. Legal ownership, physical use and control of the operations remain in the parent’s hands. How- ever, earnings are reported separately and are attributed to the tracking stock. Thus, legally, shareholders have a share in the parent company but their entitle- ment to dividends is based on the performance of designated operations. This will allow the trading stock to be valued separately in the <i>stock market </i>at a <i>price earnings ratio </i>that reflects the subsidiary’s distinct earnings stream. Issuance of tracking stock is often a preliminary step to divestiture or possibly to create an “acquisition currency” to buy something. In the meantime, it allows the parent</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">and subsidiary to share common benefits, possibly operating synergies, tax losses and a debt rating. Tracking stock was an innovation of General Motors (USA) following its 1984 investment in Electronic Data Systems and later, Hughes Electronics – two companies with very distinct attributes compared to the automobile business. Both operations were ultimately disposed as GM re- trenched to its core business. The idea of tracking stocks became a fad near the peak of the stock market in 1999 and 2000 as many companies looked for ways to get high value for their high <i>price-earnings </i>internet operations. Their popu- larity has since waned.
