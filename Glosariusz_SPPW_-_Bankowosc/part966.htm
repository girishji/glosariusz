Inthemeantime, alenderwillmonitor and control the customer’s activities to safeguard their interests as well as impose a healthy <i>financial discipline </i>on borrowers. The ‘originate and hold’ model is the traditional modus operandi for banks. Its greatest merit is that because a lender must ‘live with their mistakes’, they will tend to be more prudent and conscien- tious in granting credit (see quote below). Its greatest shortcoming is that it forces a bank to tie up scarce capital for the duration of a loan.

Exploiting its customer relationships, delivery channels and credit risk assessment capabilities, a bank will focus on the <i>origination </i>of new loans. But once loans have been booked, it will sell them on a non-recourse basis to third party investors thereby eliminat- ing its credit exposure and the need to consume bank capital. The bank will extract revenue from the process in three ways. First, it will earn a one-time fee for origination. Second, it will earn ongoing fees for servicing (e.g. collecting interest and principal, following up on arrears etc.) the loan portfolio on behalf of third party investors. Finally, since the borrowers continue to perceive the bank as their “lender”, a bank can pursue <i>cross-selling </i>activities to generate in- cremental income on other services and financial products. The model also fa-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">vours investors. Sitting on large pools of capital but having no outlets to place it, they can enjoy greater access to ‘loan product’. Borrowers also can benefit from lower interest rates that come from the increased supply of loan capital. Thus, the ‘originate and sell’ has the potential for win-win-win benefits to everybody. Alas, a potential flaw is <i>moral hazard </i>from lenders worrying less about the qual- ity of their decisions when they can ‘get rid’ of exposure (see quote below). Such flaws were particularly apparent in the sub-prime crisis in the USA. They have prompted some disgruntled investors to assert recourse against originators for faulty ‘product’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="124" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4243.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part965.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part967.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
