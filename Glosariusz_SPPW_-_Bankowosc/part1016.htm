Re-dis- counting is one of several ways a central bank can support the banking system. In its capacity as a <i>lender of last resort </i>it can simply choose to make an unsecured standby line of credit available to a bank and thereby be- come a participate in the inter-bank market (see <i>frozen credit markets</i>). Re-discounting is a way to offer more conditional support to truly deserv- ing banks. If a bank does not have <i>qualifying assets</i>, it is denied liquidity. This is meant to avoid the <i>moral hazard </i>of rescuing misfits (see <i>liquidity vs. solvency</i>). However, by relaxing the quality standards to qualify assets for discounting, a central bank can also relieve a selling bank of exposure to questionable assets. This is a more pro-active form of “stealthy” sup- port which starts to approach a rescue which may, or may not, be within a central bank’s mandate (see quote below which is in the context of ECB’s official mandate being confined to price stability). The reference to a physi- cal “window” alludes to a cash cage where a client could go to collect cash.

For example in Canada, floating interest rates reference what is called a “prime” rate. Thus a borrower might be quoted a loan at, say, “prime plus 1%”. Other banks may use terms such as “base” rate or “cost of funds” to set floating interest rates. While the reference rate is set by the bank itself, it is usu- ally market driven and is at least transparent and public. The other more stringent definition of a reference rate is one that neither party to a finan- cial contract can manipulate. The rate is set by an independent body and is thus impartial for both parties. A government treasury bill interest rate could serve this purpose.

A reg- istry search is an important <i>due diligence </i>step in the <i>perfection </i>of security. Lenders will do a registry search either to check for competing claims or to confirm that their own interests are on title. (In the case of unregistered assets, other means must be employed such as establishing a “chain of title” in the case of unregistered property). While legal documents (e.g. deeds or charge documents) may evidence <i>clear title</i>, absolute certainty comes from a confirmation of the public registry records.
