Few borrowers can satisfy an unexpected </span>demand <span class="p">for repayment immediately. It takes time to accumulate cash, arrange alternative financing or sell an asset. At the same time, creditors cannot be expected to wait forever if their capital is perilously at risk. A distressed borrower’s viability may be diminishing with time and pledged as- sets may be subject to shrinkage. Quantifying what is “sufficient” may be defined by statute law (e.g. the UK’s Section 103 of the Law of Property Act of 1925). Or, it may be defined in the lending contract. Because few contracts specify a precise time period, there may be room for interpretation. A contract that says: “Repayable upon written notification” (implying some kind of reasonable time period) has a different meaning than one that says: “Immediately repay-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">able at the sole discretion of the lender upon notification at any time” (implying right away). In the event of a dispute, common law legal systems tend to apply a test of reasonableness i.e. judgmental criteria. For example, most courts would say that a business loan which has been previously the subject of <i>recovery work- out </i>efforts could be called faster (within, say, one week) than a householder’s residential mortgage which was three months in arrears (callable within, say, 2–3 months).

Despite the force of past habit or emotional pressures, sunk costs should be consciously ignored when gauging financial reality. In the case of banks, the issue arises in the valuation of loans and the collateral backing them. When considering restructuring or liquidation alternatives, the original amount of the loan is a “sunk cost”. The relevant comparison should be made against a realistic calculation of net realisable value under forced sale, an amount which</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="141" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4825.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1100.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1102.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
