Once bank balance sheets have been cleansed of questionable assets, market <i>confidence </i>will be restored. The logic is that a “once and for all, clean sweep fix” is a better palliative than having bad loans slowly bleed a bank to death. Sweden’s Securum in the 1990s is an example of a bad bank that was successful (largely because it was run by business people, not public administrators). A more recent example is Ireland’s National Asset Management Agency (see quote below which refers to the bad bank trying to unsuccessfully force an asset sale). The disadvantage of a bad bank is that they are generally less effective in reversing, or even containing, the mistakes of others. Thus, the other approach to the problem is to have the banks that made the bad loans in the first place clean up their own mess. If govern- ment support is necessary, it can be provided by a government safety net.

Blood pressure was raised by government rescues (costing taxpayers and an affront to free market ideolo- gy), high banker compensation, niggardly lending policies as banks retrenched and the collateral damage done to the real economy (job losses). Whether de- served or not, some prominent bankers gained ‘whipping boy’ status (In the UK, the outgoing head of the insolvent Royal Bank of Scotland had his home vandalised). The bad banker fit with the more negative attributes (e.g. greed, stupidity or cold-heartedness etc.) of the traditional <i>banker’s image. </i>In fact, it’s an old story. The character of Henry F. Potter, the irascible banker in the Ameri-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">can 1946 movie classic <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i>, is perhaps the quintessential bad banker. The role is rated one of “Greatest Villains in American film history”. Since the banking industry is so much in the public eye, the notion of the inher- ently bad character is understandable in bad times.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="54" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2697.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part620.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part622.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
