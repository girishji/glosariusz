Common examples would include service charges for transactions, fees for financial advice or asset man- agement fees. Fee income contrasts with spread income on lending activities and securities trading income, both of which require a bank to put capital at risk. Because of the loss of income from <i>disintermediation </i>and the scarcity of <i>bank capital</i>, banks are increasing trying to extract fee income from their cli- ent base. This can make fees contentious since banks have the power (based on standing account operation agreements) to simply take them directly by debit- ing their customer’s balances (vs. rendering invoices). In the case of transaction- generated fees, banks can be seen to ‘nickle and dime’ customers by collecting</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">small, unnoticed charges. That said, the business model of most commercial banks is still founded on lending. For example, in the case of Scotiabank, 38% of its total revenues are from non-lending activities, of which 26% is fee in- come (see below; Annual Report, p. 107). In other words, three quarters of the bank requires it to take risks. Fees may be taken into income when paid.
