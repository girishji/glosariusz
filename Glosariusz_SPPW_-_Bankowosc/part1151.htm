The query is most common in consumer and <i>small business </i>lending where financial status may be less transparent compared to larger entities. Cer- tainly, before offering any <i>forbearance</i>, a lender needs to be sure that borrow- ers are truly unable to perform as promised. Additionally, some borrowers may harbour resentment against large financial institutions (see <i>bankers’ image</i>) that can rationalise default (e.g. “Big, impersonal banks are exploiting small, destitute borrowers” or “They got us into trouble by lending us the money.”). A clue to won’t pay is the absence of any partial, “we’re trying our best”, attempts at pay- ment (it would indeed be an odd co-incidence that a cash shortage exactly equals a scheduled repayment). Another clue is the absence of any initiative in address- ing the problem with the bank. The “won’t pay or can’t pay” query is pertinent in collection efforts. It is no use cajoling a truly financially distressed borrower. Bet- ter to work with them, perhaps resort to security realisation or, if necessary, get on with writing-off the debt as unrecoverable. However, if it is a matter of “won’t pay”, then a strong assertion of <i>creditor’s rights </i>is called for, applied by persistent and hard fought collection efforts. Sometimes, in the case of business enterprises with competing calls on cash for operations, debt repayment and capital expen- ditures, the reasons for default may be blurred. Often a borrower could possibly repay a lender by sacrificing the business’s future (i.e. enter into a wind-down) but owners would have little motivation in “working for the bank”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="108" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_5039.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1150.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1152.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
