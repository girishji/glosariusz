SIFIs represent two dangers. In the case of <i>megabanks </i>with large balance sheets, their direct counterparty impacts can lead to <i>contagion </i>via a classic “domino effect”. In the case of smaller firms extensively engaged in trading any unexpected loss- es in a so-called “long tail event” can spill over to accelerating losses elsewhere as vulnerable firms desperately sell their assets to a declining market. Thus, SIFI default imposes a “negative externality” on the rest of the rest of economy that compels an involuntary <i>too-big-to-fail doctrine</i>. After the Credit Crisis of 2007–</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">–2009, many countries were determined to avoid expensive <i>bailouts </i>(see quote below). This prompted a greater focus on macro-prudential regulation that dampened <i>systematic risk</i>. The <i>Financial Stability Board </i>proposed special regu- lations for SIFIs, which were officially endorsed by G20 members in 2010. Each authority will pursue its own agenda. For most, the first line of defence will be a <i>capital surcharge </i>requiring extra capital above and beyond the “adequacy” of the <i>Basel Capital Accords </i>(which is seen as primarily a micro-prudential safe- guard). Such surcharges will either encourage SIFI to cap their size (and even shrink) or maintain their dimensions only if there are sufficient risk-adjusted</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="300" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4843.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1202 <span class="s28">Systematically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="248" alt="image" src="Image_4844.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">returns. Not surprisingly, many large banks will object to the new rules.

The fear elicited by that pros- pect led the Bush Administration to ask for TARP author- ity. That same fear led many members of Congress with no great love for large financial firms to vote for TARP... For all the disagreements among legislators, policy officials, and the public over the right set of financial reform meas- ures, I have noted one point on which there is near una- nimity: No one wants another TARP program. Not those who thought TARP was the best of a bad set of options in the fall of 2008. Certainly not those who opposed it. Not the American people, many of whom saw the injection of billions of dollars of government capital into financial firms as more a bail-out of large banks than an imperative to stabilize the financial system. And not even, I suspect, most of the large financial firms that received the govern- ment capital.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Regulating Systemically Important Financial Firms,</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">speech by FRB Governor Daniel Tarullo, 3 June 2011</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="76" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4846.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1105.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1107.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
