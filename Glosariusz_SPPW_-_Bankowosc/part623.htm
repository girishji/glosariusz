Adverse business conditions, management misjudgement or imprudent risk taking, may then see <i>defaults </i>and slippage into “non-performing” status, especially if monitoring was lax. With weak control, loans can then deteriorate to “doubtful” (full recovery questionable; need to exercise collateral rights; set up loan loss provisions) and finally end up as “bad”, a classification usually synonymous with a <i>write-off</i>. Bad loans are every credit officer’s nightmare. Granting more than a few of them and you ruin a career; more can ruin a whole bank.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="137" height="192" alt="image" src="Image_2703.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1741"><span class="s22">Bagehot, Walter (&amp; Banking History) </span></a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark273" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part32.htm#bookmark273" class="s24">Bagehot </a><span class="s60">Walter (a historia bankowości) </span>– A 19<span class="s342">th </span>century</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">(1826–1877) English banker, political economist and journalist (editor of “The Economist” Newspa- per and writer of seminal works on Britain’s unwrit- ten constitution) who invented the treasury bill and who explained, in his classic book <i>Lombard Street</i>, the “concrete realities” of the London money market. The description of the inner workings of the mysteri- ous financial markets was more than popular read- ing. For many years it was treated as a theoretical economics textbook. Alfred Marshall’s immensely</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">popular 19<span class="s342">th </span>century <i>Principals of Economics </i>(1890) didn’t even have the word “bank” in the its index; rather Bagehot’s name. Lombard Street also was a piece of brilliant lobbying that had influence in the <i>City</i>. Bagehot had to reconcile seemingly opposite ideas. The prevailing laissez faire ideology and the absence, because most 19<span class="s342">th </span>century banks were small, of the <i>too big to fail doctrine</i>, said that banks could and should fail like any other business. Yet the banking system needed outside help to preserve <i>confidence </i>in a <i>panic. </i>Bagehot initiated break- through thinking for his time by showing that even healthy financial markets had a legitimate need for someone to play the role of <i>lender of last resort</i>. It was a job that was, like it or not, best suited to the <i>Bank of England</i>, then a large, very prestigious <i>private bank. </i>But the ‘Old Lady of Threadneedle Street’ was dis- inclined to acknowledge any responsibilities beyond a profit-maximizing duty to its own shareholders. Indeed, it felt that for the sake of a healthy financial discipline, other commercial banks should be made to believe that they were on their own and that they should carry their own liquidity reserves accordingly. Bagehot appreciated the link between economic prosperity and a well-managed financial system: “Money will not manage itself, and Lombard Street has a great deal of money to manage.” Of necessity, he foresaw that crisis management</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="41" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2704.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part622.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part624.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
