One way to get around this problem immediately would be to properly pull the master branch from GitHub, and then cherry pick the commit corresponding to the work you just did:
git remote add origin 'url to github repo'
git pull origin master
git checkout master
git cherry-pick <SHA-1 of commit you just made>
git commit -m 'Made a change to the master branch'
git push origin master

As the other answers stated, you can place .gitignore within any directory in a Git repository.
