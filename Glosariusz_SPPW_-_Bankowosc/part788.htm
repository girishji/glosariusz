Apart from any rights specifically con- tained in the loan contract, the debtor has the general rights that most of us have. Lenders must deal with them honestly, not bankrupt the debtor or seize its property without good reason etc. (see <i>sufficient notice</i>). These rights are rarely spelled out in legislation but are upheld in the courts in common law countries. The theory and practice of debtors’ rights is best developed in the United States. Breach of debtor rights can result in lend- er liability. Debtors’ rights are a subset of the broader consumer rights of bank customers which includes non-credit matters such as the faithful handling of deposits and transaction processing. Because of their fiduci-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">ary duty of care and common social attitudes that favour the ‘little guy ver- sus the big guy’, many legal systems often put an extra onus on banks (see quote below). One of the after affects of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 is a heightened sense of debtors’ rights and a greater assertiveness in stand- ing up for them.
