The benefit could be recognised in the period the credit was taken or amortised over the life of the fixed asset that prompted the tax credit. Another common tax credit is for taxes that are paid in other tax regimes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5373"><span class="s22">Tax Deferral </span></a><a href="part504.htm#bookmark1226" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Odroczenie płatności podatku </span><span class="s23">• </span>The delay in the timing of the pay- ment <i>income taxes</i>.
