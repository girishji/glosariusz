This is done largely without regard to the company’s underlying situation or performance. Patterns include <i>head and shoulders</i>, “double tops”, trends, waves and even Fibonacci’s “golden ratio” of 1.618. The <i>Efficient Stock Market Hypothesis </i>(weak variant) tells us that share prices already incorporate all past information. Price move- ments are therefore random reflecting brand-new information. This suggests that chartism should not work at all, except perhaps in markets (e.g. foreign- exchange) where non-profit maximizing authorities such as central banks are involved. Chartism has relatively little credibility amongst theorists. That said, chartists would remind you that <i>fundamental </i>analysis (e.g. examining econom- ic statistics and financial results) is hardly infallible. And, to the extent that there is a psychology to the market (see <i>behavioural finance</i>), their predictions may have a self-fulfilling aspect.
