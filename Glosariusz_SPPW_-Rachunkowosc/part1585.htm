Of necessity, it may well involve paying a cost by a sacrifice of self-interest. There are two main reasons that accountants need to have high standards of ethical integrity. First, because any yard- stick used to measure must be autonomous (i.e. an external, objective reference point), <i>accounting users </i>are dependent on accounting information that is reliably accurate and neutral. Since accounting information is used in <i>financial decision-making</i>, measure- ment errors can have adverse consequences. In extremis, there is even the possibility of a purposeful distortion of the financial truth. To cite a simple example, if account- ing profits are artificially boosted, share prices will be overvalued (ignoring the “strong form” of the <i>Efficient Market Hypothesis </i>which tells us that markets cannot be fooled this way). This basic standard of conduct is simply a faithful “compliance” to the rules. It is not so much an ethical standard as honest competency. A second, and higher, level of ethical standard is in the pursuit of a <i>fair presentation </i>that consciously considers the needs of accounting users, especially if the <i>asymmetric information problem </i>(i.e. outsiders cannot possibly know everything going on inside the entity) is at work. This higher standard particularly applies to external <i>auditors </i>who, as a <i>public accountancy profession</i>, have a fiduciary duty to the <i>public interest</i>. The capital market appreciates that the financial reporting model contains <i>accounting estimates </i>and <i>disclosure </i>options that leave a degree of discretionary “wiggle room” in portraying financial results. As well, the markets are aware that the <i>agency problem </i>(i.e. hired managers do not share exactly the same interests as shareholders) can tempt managers to try to look better by <i>window dressing</i>. These forces collectively necessitate a role for an external auditor who is expert, neutral and empowered to enforce both honest and fair reporting. Yet prac- tical considerations require that management must take the initiative for producing the financial statements. As well, since the market rewards lower <i>accounting risk </i>with a lower cost of capital (hence a higher share price), companies have a built-in incentive</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1584.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1586.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
