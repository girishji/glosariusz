Contrast to term to maturity that is the original pe- riod of time between the loan being advanced and its final repayment date. In the case of loans that <i>revolve</i>, tenor is, of necessity, virtually immediate because loans can be continuously drawn down and repaid. In this situation, tenor can be described as <i>on demand</i>. A bank has the legal right (albeit it constrained by “reasonable notice” standards under the law) to terminate the loan contract and call for full repayment (often in the charming phrase of “at its pleasure”). This flexibility was traditionally meant to reflect the nature of a bank’s deposit liabilities which were also on demand. When tenor is on demand, a <i>loan agree- ment </i>becomes less of a firmly binding contract than a convenient descrip- tion of terms and conditions which will prevail so long as the bank chooses</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4868.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">to continue lending. In the case of loans that must be repaid in the future on a specific date, tenor is said to be committed. Here a bank’s rights of demand are strictly defined within the <i>loan agreement. </i>A bank is contractually bound to keep lending and agrees to forfeit its discretionary demand rights in favour of a specified set of circumstances (“events of <i>default”</i>) where it can be repaid. In such cases, a loan agreement becomes a precisely defined loan contract. So- phisticated borrowers, concerned about the power given to a bank by the rights of demand, usually prefer a committed tenor. Or, some borrowers need to be certain ahead of time that bank credit is available. For this service, they are usually charged a commitment fee. A tightly drafted <i>loan agreement </i>can make the <i>committed tenor </i>almost as powerful as the demand tenor, reflecting the tra- ditional prerogative of the bank to supply credit on discretionary and selective terms. The word is used more often with regard to <i>bills of exchange </i>or <i>letters of credit </i>than <i>loan agreement</i>s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4869.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SHYLOCK:</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When it is paid according to <b>tenor</b>.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It doth appear you are a worthy judge.
