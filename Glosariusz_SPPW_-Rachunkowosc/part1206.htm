Under the rules, if the numbers on the sheet were high enough, the company had to report them.

Its inclusion in finan- cial reports is more as a matter of <i>disclosure</i>. However, if the event is in fact additional evidence of condition(s) that existed at the balance sheet date, a retroactive change in the financial statements should be initiated.
