Were there large cost overruns? Have cash flows fulfilled expectations? While the sunk cost nature of a capital expenditure means you “can’t go back”, a post- audit can provide useful lessons for the future, either through better forecasting techniques (e.g. eliminating biases, empire-building, pet causes or naivety) or a greater appreciation of the true risks involved (e.g. appreciating <i>sensitivity anal- ysis</i>). As well, when managers know that their forecasts will be compared to actual results, they tend to become more conscientious as forecasters (see <i>ac- countability</i>). Post-audit zeal cannot be taken to excess: projects seldom unfold exactly as planned; they are often effected by forces outside any forecaster’s con-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">trol and mistakes are inherent to risk-taking. Nonetheless, a thorough but bal- anced post-audit provides a healthy discipline in the <i>capital budgeting process </i>by putting good decisions “on paper” to the test of their actual results.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5023">£.s.d. </a><span class="s47">(British) </span><a href="part228.htm#bookmark584" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Funt szterling </span><span class="s48">(waluta brytyjska) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">The abbreviation for </span><span class="p">pounds (from the Latin “pondo” = 12 ounce weight equivalent to silver worth 20 shillings), shillings and pence used synonymously for money or riches (from the Latin for librae, solidi, denarii).

Over a brief span of time, a modest interest rate, say 8%, will not make the original capital in- vested grow by much (assuming that 8% is not that “much”).
