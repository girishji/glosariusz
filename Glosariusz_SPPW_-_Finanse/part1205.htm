A black market can also include legal goods sold illicitly to avoid tax payments (e.g. cigarettes) or licensing requirements (e.g. unregistered firearms). Black markets, which are present in most economies, will arise when- ever the state tries to restrict the unfettered operation of market demand. Ironi- cally, black markets will prosper the most when state restrictions are the heavi- est. In the case of <i>foreign currency </i>transactions, black market exchange rates are a proxy for a country’s economic state.

In the vernacular of op- tions this thing – be it a currency, commodity or security - is referred to as the “underlying” in the sense of something lying underneath, or in the background, of the option.

While originally designed for quoted options, it can be used for <i>over-the-counter </i>options and for non-financial op- tions for that matter. The formula was developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton (The latter two individuals received the Nobel Prize in Economics; although Black was the first to develop it, he died in 1995 and was ineligible for the prize).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="106" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4362.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1204.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1206.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
