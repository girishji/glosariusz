It can also be more secure since documents are susceptible to loss or theft.

This is done in the hope of making them more efficient without sacrificing their safety. Some prominent examples of financial market deregulation include the Big Bang in London in 1987 allowing market-determined trading commissions and the lifting of the restriction against combining investment and commercial banking activities in the USA in 2001. Prior to deregulation, even free-market oriented governments proactively intervened in financial markets. This was justified in order to protect the public interest which was thought to be vulnerable to the failure of a bank. Deregu- lation of financial markets is part of a broader trend to harness free market forces in the airlines, telcoms and other utility-like industries serving the public. The logic is that it is in the “public interest” to have greater efficiency, choice and freedom when- ever a base-line safety of operations can be assured. Another element at work was the sheer complexity of modern markets which made centralised, interventionalist oversight obsolete. In the case of financial institutions, deregulation is often de- signed on a “loose-tight” basis (i.e. create firm prudential boundaries which are “tight” and cannot be crossed but still allowing some “loose” freedom of manoeuvre within the boundaries). For example, the capital adequacy rules of Basel I &amp; II try to ensure that banks always have sufficient capital to protect the public’s interest. In turn, the profit maximising behaviour of managers acting on behalf of shareholders can be relied upon in the pursuit of both efficiency and prudence.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3683">Dilution </a><a href="part724.htm#bookmark1858" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Rozcieńczenie </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">The impact on existing shareholders from an enter- prise issuing more shares and thereby spreading the total value of equity over a larger number of shareholders and thus reducing each share’s value.
