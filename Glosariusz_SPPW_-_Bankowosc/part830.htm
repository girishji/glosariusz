The faith is that the public is better served by unfettered but wholesome competition in an open “playing field”. The criti- cal assumption is that fiduciary obligations are not compromised and safety is assured by market information and regulator oversight. Dealing with risk be- comes a ‘pricing issue’. In spite of a shift to de-regulation in banking, govern- ments continue to keep a watchful eye on the industry. Indeed, after a scare such as the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, governments may be tempted to re-regulate. De-regulation is anchored in an implicit faith in the Efficient Market Hypoth- esis (EMH) which suggests that market forces are able to price risk accurately and thereby manage it. Working against such confidence (apart from scepticism</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3630.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">about EMH itself) is the fear that the market cannot cope with the existence of systematic risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="421" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3631.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The banking sector, at that time, was highly uncompetitive.

This led to some improvements in customer experience, but it also made bankers more ag- gressive in their pursuit of new profits (particularly as public ownership of large financial companies became more com- mon).
