If there is slack in the economy or if inflation falls, interest rate policy should be reduced to stimulate output. When applied to actual US interest rates (below), it suggests that the Federal Reserve waited too long to increase interest rates and thus perhaps precipitated the asset bubble leading up to the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3111">Teaser Interest </a><span class="s52">(vernacular) </span><a href="part390.htm#bookmark1282" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Promocyjne oprocentowanie </span><span class="s32">(potoczne) </span><span class="s65">– </span><span class="p">An interest rate that is well below market rates as a temptation to borrow by virtue of near-term affordability. The connotation of “tease” is in the sense of being sexually provocative. Interest will subsequently be re-set after the initial relief period expires in, say, 1–2 years. Teasers were a common feature of many sub-prime mortgages in the USA in the run up to the housing bubble. They made some sense to help out first-time homeowners to enter a market that they might otherwise be excluded. In addition, so long as housing prices continued to escalate, the homeowner would gain financially. But teasers exposed bor- rowers to ‘interest rate shock’ when rates returned to normal (or higher than normal to recoup the costs of the upfront subsidy). They were also the source of many defaults once the housing bubble burst.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3112"><span class="s22">Technical Default </span></a><a href="part253.htm#bookmark706" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Naruszenie technicznych warunków umowy </span>– A sub- set of <i>default </i>caused by failure to comply with the terms and conditions of a loan contract that do not involve the payment of money.

As well, practically speaking, exercising drastic rem- edies would be like using a “nuclear weapon when diplomacy or conventional weapons are needed”. It would be hard, for example, to call a loan if financial statements are late. However, lenders must be careful to pro-actively assert their creditor<b>’</b>s rights or else technical defaults will lose their usefulness. Moreover, excessive <i>forbearance </i>will cause borrowers, and even courts of law, to treat them casually.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="227" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4859.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1109.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1111.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
