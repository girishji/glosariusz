Sloppy documentation, along-with legal disputes in an inherently litigious society over the respective rights and responsibilities of lenders, loan servicers, borrowers and investors in complex <i>securitisations </i>has combined to gum up the process of <i>foreclosure</i>. Up to $1 trillion in defaulted mortgages cannot be resolved by the conventional mechanism of repossession, security realisation, asset liquidation, repayment and write-off. The foreclosure crisis is complex, messy and has several culprits. By dumping supply on the real estate market, a high volume of foreclosures (3.5 million homes in 2010 according to “International Herald Tribune”, 29/10/10, p. 20) triggered a down- ward property price spiral that hurt everyone. In those states (11 in total) with</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">non-recourse privileges, many homeowners have chosen to walk away from homes with negative equity. Because securitised mortgages are administered by ‘mortgage service providers’, there is a ‘disconnection’ between borrowers and lenders. Such disinterested third parties often render poor-quality service. The frantic pace of origination in the “go-go days” (see quote below) often resulted in slipshod, or worse fraudulent, loan documentation. Later on, this could re- sult in instances of illegal actions (e.g. unjustified evictions etc.). A paperless registry system (the industry-owned database MERS or Mortgage Electronic Registry Systems) proved to be either flawed or was challenged in many courts. Investors in mortgage bonds are currently pressing banks with buyback provi- sions to take back the flawed product. Finally, there is the political element. Angry taxpayer-homeowners are suffering financially while their tax dollars are used to bailout banks, the very institutions causing them grief. While the Oba- ma administration’s Home Affordability Modification Program was designed to help homeowners negotiate with lenders to avoid default and foreclosure, it has proved to be an inadequate palliative given the magnitude of the problem.
