This way they get bigger, more diversified, (hopefully) more efficient and (omi- nously) can wield more market power. Mergers have traditionally been a com- mon route to growth especially because of a tendency for a Darwinian ‘survival of the fittest’ in the banking sector. Strong banks gobble up weak ones (see quote below). In the case of our example bank, the Scotia has merged with twelve other financial institutions over its 176 year history to date (ref: Wikipedia). From the late 1990s when commercial pressures from <i>liberalisation </i>first began to arise, banks have been particularly active in merging. The justifications given typically include the following:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">globalisation requires size to compete</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">information technology presents economies of scale opportunities</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="s33">cross-selling </span><span class="p">between different financial services presents economies</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of scope opportunities</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="s33">disintermediation </span><span class="p">is eroding core markets; everybody’s revenue base</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">is shrinking</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">in the case of Europe, the euro and EU has created, at least on paper,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">a single market</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">larger banks are more diversified and better able to shoulder risks.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Another, more fundamental driver might be the economics of the banking market. In mature and saturated markets such as financial services, it is hard to get ‘top line’ revenue growth without compromising asset quality. The only remaining route to profit growth is an internal focus on efficient operations. This in turn tends to encourage aggregations and ‘size for size sake’. Not to be ignored is an almost romantic attachment to size as a proxy for leadership or quality. This ‘empire-building’ temptation may be even stronger in the banking</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="81" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2803.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">740 <span class="s28">Bank Mergers</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2804.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">industry than in others since management’s power tends to be based on the span of operations. Indeed, when examined through the lens of shareholder value creation, bank mergers may not be such a good idea. The fact that world’s largest banks have tended to trade on lower earnings multiples than smaller institutions tells us something. Whatever business justifications banks employ, bank mergers can create public policy issues. As a <i>regulated </i>industry, which has been traditionally protected from the rigours of unbridled market compe- tition<i>, </i>mergers within national markets can create monopolised power (cross border mergers are harmless but less popular). Another public concern is the large bank’s indifference to the “little guy”, especially <i>small and medium enter- prises</i>. Yet another is the fear of excessive size and a greater vulnerability to the <i>too big to fail doctrine</i>. In the post-credit crisis world, big banks – so-called <i>systematically important financial institutions </i>– are being discouraged. Finally, the merger transaction itself can be a difficult and even dangerous move to pull off. Because of the need to offer an acquisition premium, acquirers can end up over-paying. If a purchase is financed with more leverage, the combined entity’s risks may increase. Moreover, banks are opaque entities. It is easy to buy junk. Finally, risk management can ‘slip through the cracks’ when management is distracted by the post-merger integration of distinctive cultures and incompat- ible operating systems. The demise of the once-proud Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008 in buying Holland’s ABN-AMRO Bank for $100+ billion serves to prove many of these hazards. After the merger, RBS would go on to post a £25 billion loss, the biggest ever in UK corporate history. Its share price fell over 95% from a 52-week high. Ultimately, it had to be rescued by the UK government. It is in- structive that the Canadian government has continued to have a long standing prohibition against <i>Canadian bank </i>mergers amongst the Big Six.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2805.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">From 1810 onwards, throughout the following fifty years, joint stock banks were to be established in most of the lar- ge towns and in some of the smaller if they happened to be conveniently situated in the centre of agriculture or indu- stry and where their services were likely to be of use to the local community; but many were to enjoy a short life and a gay one.
