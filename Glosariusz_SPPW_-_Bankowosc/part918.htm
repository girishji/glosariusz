This way, the interests of financial markets and stakeholders are respected. While the evolution of a secondary market in distressed company debt has tended to temper the need for the London Approach, its usefulness has been demonstrated by enough successes that it continued to have a positive acceptance in the market.

During BAU (“business as usual”) periods, banks may expect a certain level of losses based on their past experience. They will cope with these ‘costs of doing business’ by add- ing risk premiums in their pricing and diversifying. Unexpected (the “known unknowns”) losses will be addressed by bank capital and liquidity buffers in case they misjudge the expected. Long tail risks are equivalent to “unknown unknowns” (to quote US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld). With enough imagination, they are conceivable but thought to be so remote that they are not worth worrying about. However, arguably they are in fact very real. It is just a matter of time before they strike (see quote below). The humbling experience of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 has made everybody more aware of long tail</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">risks.
