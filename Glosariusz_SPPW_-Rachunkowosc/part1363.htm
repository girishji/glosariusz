Today, it has now gained full acceptance after international accounting standards were revised in 2005. We can illustrate the mechanics of the closing rate method in the table below. The closing rate method shelters the income statement from the impact of fluctuations on translation (although gains/losses will still occur for <span class="s27">foreign currency transactions</span>). To appreciate the merits of the closing rate method, it helps to see the underlying logic at work with as well as some historical con- siderations. Implicitly, it treats the foreign subsidiary as an “autonomous operation”, a single, arms’ length investment of the parent. One rate is applied to all year-end net assets because the parent is looking at an overall impact on its investment in a “pot”. Performance of the subsidiary is best judged in the local context (key operating ratios such as <span class="s27">profit margin </span>are not affected). Since changes in exchange rates are presumed to have no direct effect on the cash flow of the parent company, it stands to reason that they should not be reflected in the parent’s income statement but rather its reserves. Historically, such a perspective tends to reflect trading relationships forged in colonial times before modern communication. European firms, who were the first to go over- seas, consequently traditionally favoured an autonomous classification and the closing method. Later American firms followed suit after currency volatility (USD free floated in 1970s) caused their previously preferred temporal method to make income statement results more volatile.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1362.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1364.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
