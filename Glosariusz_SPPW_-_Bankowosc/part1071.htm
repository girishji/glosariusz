The first, which is valid when true, is that short-term debt finances short- term needs; it is therefore often directly <b>self-liquidating</b>; or at least it can be paid either from the liquidation of assets in the normal course of business or from cash flow in the short run. In neither case does repayment threaten the company’s ability to continue the business. The second ar- gument is more facile, and of dubious validity; that banks can call short-term debt at any time. This ignores the ques- tion whether the company can meet the call; in practice, it can do so only if the first point is true (in which case the bank should not even need to call), or from unused facili- ties, often referred to as refinancing ability.
