The letter is normally issued annually in conjunction with an <i>audit. </i>As part of the audit service package, it is “free” advice, often given in the hopes of substantiating the audit’s value and/or the auditor’s prowess. While the letter may touch upon any area worthy of productive advice, it typically concentrates on matters closest to an auditor’s heart: <i>accounting</i>, <i>internal controls, risk management </i>and <i>corpo- rate governance. </i>A management letter falls well short of <i>management consulting advice </i>(an activity, after all, which seeks a fee). Yet because auditors dig deep into a business, it can provide useful insights. To the extent it helps reduce <i>audit risk</i>, it can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit. By implication, management letters also indirectly appraise management performance and so will be of interest to an <i>audit committee.</i></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4588"><span class="s22">Management Representation Letter </span></a><a href="part551.htm#bookmark1343" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Oświadczenie zarządu </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="s26">An impor- </span>tant source of <i>audit evidence </i>for auditors to confirm certain information that, in the absence of independent and verifiable third party sources, only <i>management </i>can pro- vide.

It asks: “what should we do?” (i.e. make a decision) and once that is decided: “how should we do it?” (i.e. a plan of action). In contrast, </span>financial accounting <span class="p">concerns itself with tracking past performance for </span>stewardship <span class="p">purposes. It asks: “How did they do?” (i.e. an accountability report which is independent from those being judged). By neces- sity, financial accounting must be rule-oriented (to be understood by </span>accounting users<span class="p">), standardised (to allow </span>comparability<span class="p">) and compliance-oriented (to discipline those being measured). There is not an inherent conflict between the two but rather a different per- spective i.e. the future vs. the past. That said, managers need to be careful about keep- ing the two sorted out. A common trap is using a financial accounting mindset to make future-oriented decisions. For example, factoring in </span>sunk costs <span class="p">into a decision when in fact such costs are not relevant. The </span>Theory of the Firm <span class="p">(the true goal of the firm should be shareholder wealth maximisation) combined with the </span>Efficient Market Hypothesis <span class="p">(capital markets can incorporate broad sources of information into share price) suggests that management accounting decisions should govern behaviour. Financial accounting should simply be a neutral reflection of outcomes (as opposed for any need to manage the results). It can be argued that too much attention to financial accounting is a manifesta- tion of the </span>agency problem <span class="p">(i.e. managers want “to look good” vs. “do good”) and can hin- der the pursuit of enterprise efficiency and shareholder value creation.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1862.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1864.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
