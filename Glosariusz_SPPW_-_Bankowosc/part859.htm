Guarantees can either be for the full amount of whatever is outstanding (all monies) or limited to a specific amount. To be use- ful as collateral security, a guarantee must be in writing to be an enforceable legal contract. Guarantees may even have an indemnity clause binding the guarantor even if there is a technical flaw in the contract. The beneficiary of a guarantee ide- ally wants a “clean” (vs. conditional) instrument. Normally, all the beneficiary need do is to prove that the guarantee was correctly called and not paid. The motive for guaranteeing maybe either for the sake of consideration, fee income, altruism or ownership (see <i>personal guarantee</i>). In general, most guarantees are issued in the calculated reckoning that they will never actually have to be honoured (this “sur-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="418" height="265" alt="image" src="Image_3774.png"/></span></p><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Guarant<span class="s62">ee</span></p><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Guarant<span class="s62">ee</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Guarant<span class="s62">ee</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">prise factor” has consequences when they are called upon). In the meantime, guar- antors (i.e. those who guarantee) have certain legal rights (which will vary amongst legal regimes). For example, they often need to know the nature and extent of their potential liability; be kept up-to-date about any significant deterioration in the pri- mary debtor’s financial status; and they may have the right to approve material changes in the guaranteed obligation. As well, a creditor is often obliged to act re- sponsibly in dealing with the debt. All this means that lenders have to be ‘on their toes’ when relying on a guarantee. Guarantees can usually be unilaterally cancelled</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="85" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3775.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">960 <span class="s28">Guarantee (To)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3776.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">but only with advance notification, in which case creditors would typically call for immediate payment. Because of the potential for “escapes”, lenders must have qualified legal expertise imbedded in the guarantee’s wording (for small amounts, standard forms are usually used). Lenders also need to take care to preserve their <i>creditor rights </i>(for example, by copying important borrower cor- respondence to the guarantor). Guarantees, in themselves, are unsecured obli- gations. Lenders may want them fortified by tangible security in cases where a reliable repayment source is needed A stronger form of a guarantee is an irrevo- cable <i>letter of credit </i>that can be drawn anytime at the beneficiary’s sole discre- tion, regardless of default.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3777.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To <b>guarantee </b>loans for a stranger brings trouble.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Proverbs 11,15</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To <b>guarantee </b>loans for a stranger brings trouble.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Proverbs 11,15</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To <b>guarantee </b>loans for a stranger brings trouble.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Proverbs 11,15</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part858.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part860.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
