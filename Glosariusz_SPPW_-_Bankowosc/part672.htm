Customers pay whether they use the services or not. Bundled pricing is less transparent to customers. However, it is more convenient and avoids the perception of being “nickled and dimed” with a multitude of separate and noisome service charges. From a bank’s perspective it has two attractions. First, as a practical matter, it can be very difficult, if not impossible, to figure out the actual marginal cost of many banking services. Many products with an installed base have a large fixed or common cost component. In the absence of incremental costs, once delivery systems are installed, they can be given away. Bundled pricing is also a natural fit with relationship management whereby the client sees value not from individual transactions but rather from having an ongoing relationship</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">with the bank. That said, there are pitfalls in bundled pricing. If the bank gets the wrong mix of services in the ‘package’, customers may not perceive attrac- tive ‘value for money’ (see quote below). Also bundling can enter the realm of <i>tied selling </i>which most regulators and consumer protection agencies take a dim view of.

Their status as licensed and regulated entities tends to shield them from competitive pressures while imposing administrative compliance. As hier- archical <i>Apollo</i>-type organisations, banks naturally favour stability, order, doc- umentation and adherence to rules and procedures. Because banks deal with risk, they must of necessity be cautious and thorough. It can be difficult to avoid going too far (‘paralysis by analysis’). The agency problem can tempt bank staff to passively hide behind forms and procedures instead of taking the initiative to make sensible decisions, satisfy customers and thereby create value for bank shareholders. Even the embedded personality traits of the <i>commercial banker</i>, which tends to crave order, precision and certainty, can lead to bureaucratic</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">proclivities. Well-managed banks will consciously fight against the “disease” of bureaucracy. Bank leadership will try to cultivate a “commercial” organisational culture (What do our customers need? What is the competition doing? How much money will we earn? etc.). An emphasis on accountability and discre- tionary authority encourages bankers to be responsive to customer needs and to gauge profit implications. A branch network with its loose-tight structure (i.e. freedom to manoeuvre within strict boundaries) combined with profit centred performance measures allow a bank’s operations to be decentralised and more responsive to local markets (see <i>community banking</i>). In lending, an ingrained sense of credit professionalism amongst experienced staff with long-term career ambitions encourages judicious and confident decisions. A robust <i>credit culture </i>will not be a slave to rigid, superficial formalities but</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="121" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2944.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part671.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part673.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
