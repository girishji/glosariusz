The roots of private banking go back to the early 19<span class="s342">th </span>century Brit- ain when private banks were called “country banks” because of their location. Such banks, which were built on localised knowledge and trust, would evolve into modern commercial banking through consolidation. Because the personal assets of partners (who were often wealthy merchants) stood behind deposit lia- bilities, they were considered sound. In addition, the partners, who knew and re- lied on one another, tended to make better decisions. But private banks had lim- itations: unlimited liability laws (introduced in 1870s) made banking too risky a business for most partners; being confined to a community, they remained too small to be diversified; they were too numerous and too secretive, especially regarding insider dealing, to be regulated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4329.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I can imagine nothing better in theory or more successful in practice than <b>private banks </b>as they were in the beginning.
