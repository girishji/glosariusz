Because most people are <i>risk-averse</i>, they tend to value the avoidance of a loss more than opportunity for gain. This may be reinforced by <i>herd instinct</i>: amongst a group, losses will tend to stand out in the crowd whereas forgone gains (an <i>opportunity cost</i>) are less noticed. However, gambler’s comfort is often “cold comfort”. People can be blind to how bad things could be. It may explain why commercial enterprises often avoid <i>hedging </i>strategies: in favourable markets, shareholders may not appreciate that forgone profits are a legitimate price to pay for protection against the downside of unfavourable markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The company is left with only the feeble <span class="s30">gambler’s comfort </span>that it could have been worse.
