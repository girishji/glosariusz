Circumstances, like a contrary wind, may cause you at times to deviate a point or two from your direct course; but you can always keep heading to- wards it. When Squire Oakfield, for instance, sends his che- que in without notice, and overdraws his account a tho- usand or two, although he has violated one of the cardinal principles of your Rules and Regulations, it would not be wise, however regular it might be, to dishonour the che- que; because the Squire is at once a wealthy and choleric gentleman, and probably believed that by overdrawing his account he was bestowing a favour rather than receiving one. You cannot afford to quarrel with the Squire. You will prefer to follow a famous example for the moment, and <b>turn your blind eye </b>upon the strict letter of instructions; because in addition to himself, his agents and tenants, and many of his nearest relatives bank with you. There is a time for gathering stones, and a time for throwing them away; but this would not be a prudent occasion for the scattering process. Once cast away from the Squire’s goodwill, and drive him to the other bank, and without any hostile action on his part, he will soon have a perceptible following.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 207pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Excerpted from “Occasional Overdrafts” in <i>The Country Banker </i>(1899) by George Rae</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2719"><span class="s22">Oversight </span></a><a href="part248.htm#bookmark689" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Nadzór </span>– A general description of the process of “keeping an eye on” the activities of people who are accountable for performance. This is done without obstructing them and only intervening if necessary to ensure that per- formance stays on track. The power of oversight comes from human nature. We all behave differently when we know we’re being watched over. An example of oversight in a bank would be the <i>credit supervision </i>role that stays out of everyday lending decisions but still watches the portfolio’s performance, even if from a distance, to ensure that lending is in accordance with credit policies. At a higher level, bank’s board of directors (supervisory board) oversees sen- ior management’s shareholder value creation, including a bank’s risk manage- ment. Oversight is doing your business by minding the business of others. It is a part of the checks and balances process of giving human organisations, with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="73" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4254.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part969.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part971.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
