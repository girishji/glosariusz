It may also be a way to realise the <i>hidden value </i>of any unrealised <i>capital gains </i>(say, from real estate assets) a company may pos- sess. For this reason, sale and lease-back transactions are often used in <i>corporate restructuring</i>. Subinvestment grade companies can also access lower cost capital compared to going to lenders or the capital markets.

We jump to conclusions too quickly. Simply put, “Confidence is the feeling you get when you don’t fully understand the situa- tion.” Or worse, our prejudices are often a result of ignorance. In the context of financial decisions, sampling error is reaching false conclusions about an over- all, “big picture” situation based upon distorted perceptions or limited access to information. For example, having just gone through a bull or <i>bear market</i>, we may reach the wrong conclusions on the market’s long term direction. We can try to avoid sampling errors by increasing the number of tests on a random basis (so biases do not creep in). We might call this the wisdom that comes from experience.
