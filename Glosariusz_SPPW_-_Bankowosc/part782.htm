This is done in the hope of increas- ing the chances of a full recovery on the remaining, reduced portion. While debt conciliations may clearly make rational sense in those instances where repayment of the full amount of debt is impossible, lenders can be inherently reluctant to be forgiving. First, there are concerns about <i>moral hazard </i>amongst other borrowers when they see a bank setting a precedent in the market of volun- tarily forgiving debt when a borrower is in financial distress. There are also often deep suspicions about whether a concession is really what is says it is (see <i>won’t</i></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">pay or can’t pay<span class="p">). Finally, an insistence upon fully honouring debts might be pig- headedness guised in a sense of indignant righteousness (see quote below).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3412.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“They hired the money, didn’t they?”</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">– US President Calvin Coolidge (1872–1933)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The famously terse creditor’s observation in response to suggestions for <b>debt conciliation </b>for allied WWI war debts from Britain and France to the USA.
