Cheques developed in Europe in the late 1600s as a short- ened form of <i>bills of exchange </i>– the latter typically backed up by an underlying trade transaction, and the former to expedite the settlement of debts between private parties without the need to worry about the physical transfer of spe- cie. Unlike <i>bank notes </i>they are not considered legal tender. No one is obliged to accept them. (In the UK, this was reinforced for generations by legislation that required workers’ wages to be paid in cash only). Well-established <i>laws of negotiable instruments </i>specify the rights and duties of the various parties us- ing cheques. Based on both custom and their advantages, payment by cheque has become an accepted and reliable convention in many countries (countries not using cheques relied on <i>giro </i>systems). The advantages were obvious to all. Using cheques is safer than cash. By mailing a cheque, the postal system acts as a payments system. The existence of a paper trail confirms payment (ver- sus having to enquire with a payee bank that funds have been received). But paper-based payment systems have their disadvantages. They can be suscep- tible to fraud (see <i>crossed cheque</i>). There are the inconveniences to the us- ers (see <i>bank account reconciliation</i>) in handling the paper work. A cheque also presents a settlement risk to the recipient (see quote below) although a cheque can be “certified” by the bank as having funds set aside. Finally, be- cause banks have to manage the flow of paper by a costly settlement and clear- ing process, the long term trend for paper-based systems is being replaced by electronic payment mediums.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3035.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The bank note is most coarse form of credit as compared to the <b>cheque</b>.
