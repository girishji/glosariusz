The situation typically arises after the market value of financed assets plum- mets. For example, after the housing bubble burst in 2006, a sub-prime mortgage borrower might say: “We are underwater on our mortgage”. In many US states where mortgage debt was on a non-recourse basis, such borrowers would walk away from their obligations. The analogy of “drowning in a sea of debt” is apt.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3169"><span class="s22">Underwrite </span></a><a href="part148.htm#bookmark479" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Gwarancja subemisyjna </span>– Broadly defined, to take responsibility for the placement of new security or loan issues – be it for equity share flotation, insurance coverage or syndicated loans – in a primary market. This is equiva- lent to a <i>guarantee </i>that any unsold financial instruments will be bought by the underwriting institution. Underwriting is most commonly associated with <i>in- vestment banks </i>that will help make a flotation more attractive to the market (e.g. “if Goldman Sachs will buy it, it must be OK”) while backstopping the amount of the issuer’s funding source. The associated risk is that the under- writer is “stuck” with a portion of an unsold issue (underwriting risk) and that market price falls below the issue price (market risk). Etymology: from the early 15 century translation of Latin for “subscriber”. Used literally at first as in to sign up. Its modern sense of “to accept the risk of insurance” (1620s) is from notion</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">of signing a marine insurance policy. Meaning “to support by a guarantee of money” is recorded from 1890.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3170">Undoubted </a><span class="s52">(vernacular) </span><a href="part260.htm#bookmark726" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Niekwestionowana zdolność kredytowa </span><span class="s32">(po- toczne) </span><span class="p">– A financial stamp of approval for companies whose size, history, in-</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="93" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4935.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1131.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1133.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
