This can be done in various ways: <i>dividends</i>, <i>transfer pric- ing</i>, management fees, <i>interest</i>, etc. The choice is typically based on what the foreign country’s laws permit and/or what is the most <i>tax efficient</i>. Ultimately any foreign direct investment must be judged like any other <i>capital expenditure </i>(i.e. net present value of its <i>relevant cash flows </i>in the future). In this regard, ex ante, foreign repatriation of earnings should be analysed net of any home coun- try taxes and converted to the home country’s currency rates after adjusting for expected foreign exchange movements.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5229">Repurchase Tender Offer </a><a href="part688.htm#bookmark1764" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Przetargowa oferta odkupu </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">The offer by a </span><span class="p">firm to buy back its own shares in the secondary market based on specified price, the number of shares it intends to repurchase, and the period of time for which it will keep the offer open.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="255" alt="image" src="Image_7122.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Punishment</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Punishment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Punishment</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5230">Reputation Risk (Share Price) </a><a href="part753.htm#bookmark1934" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Ryzyko utraty reputacji (cena akcji) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">In </span><span class="p">perfectly efficient markets, any change in the net present value of a company’s cash flows would be at least approximately reflected in share prices. However, markets may have a hard time quantifying the impact of adverse changes that could be symptomatic of deeper problems below the surface. A general level of confidence, or “reputation”, can give well-respected companies the benefit of the doubt if adversity is sufficiently rare. So the airline with a good track record of safety can get away with one crash but not two. The risk of damaging a reputa- tion is especially acute in any sector that requires a high level of public trust and confidence. Financial institutions will be severely punished by price discounts if the markets begin to perceive them as “accident prone”.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">In 1991 a trader at Salomon Brothers tried to evade rules limiting the firm’s participation in auctions of US Treasury bonds by submitting bids in the names of the company’s customers without their knowledge.When this was discovered, Salomon settled the case by paying almost $200 million in fines and establishing a $100 million fund for payments of claims from civil lawsuits.
