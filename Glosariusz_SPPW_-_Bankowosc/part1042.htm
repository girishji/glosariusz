In contrast, lines of credit deployed for <i>as- set conversion </i>purposes will revolve less since the line is being used to finance a continuing need: see <i>bank debt (role in enterprise finance)</i>. By design, unsecured “revolvers” are often meant to be used sparingly. The very fact that loans are not outstanding for long periods favours dispensing with collateral security. Such a line is meant to provide back-stop liquidity for brief periods of heavy cash de- mands. If they are used unsparingly, it is a symptom of trouble, say, operating cash flow deficits or creditors demanding early payment (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4571.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>revolvers</b>.

It is equivalent to a conditional (i.e. the asset has to be for sale) option (i.e. the holder of the right does not have to buy). Rights of first refusal are typically given to a party who has a vested interest in protecting an existing investment (e.g. land adjacent to a property owner or a majority shareholder). While in theory the giver of such a right is not dis- advantaged (“I can always get a market price”), rights of first refusal can com- plicate a sale and make the asset less liquid. Potential buyers will be discour- aged from bidding knowing that another party is standing in the wings ready to “scoop” the transaction.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2921"><span class="s22">Right to Fail Doctrine </span></a><a href="part114.htm#bookmark414" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Doktryna prawa do bankructwa </span>– An economic concept that it is necessary, and even healthy, for businesses to face the conse- quences of failure, including bankruptcy and <i>liquidation</i>. The right to fail is im- portant in truly robust competitive market economies (see quote below). Inves- tors have a more legitimate claim to the fruits of their success if they are exposed to loss. Entrepreneurship and the <i>animal spirits </i>are thereby encouraged. Ad- ditionally, lenders know that if necessary, they can exercise their <i>creditor rights </i>without having to worry about the demise of a borrower (“we feel your suffering but you agreed to it”). The right to fail is an adjunct of property rights. Owners of assets should have the freedom to do what they please with their property, in- cluding losing it if they so decide to put it at risk. In the case of banks, the right to fail superseded by the <i>too-big-to-fail doctrine</i>.
