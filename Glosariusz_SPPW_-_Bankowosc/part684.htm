By its fundamental nature, banking – a business model based on trust and confidence – is incompatible with excessive risk-taking. At the same time, as with any enterprise managed by parties separated from owners, the agency problem exists within banks. While bank regulations may try, robust <i>corporate governance </i>(to safeguard bank shareholder interests) and properly structured incentive plans can do the most to avoid casino banking.

This is by design in order to shield a currency from the pressures of policy expediency and to create public <i>confidence </i>in the durability of a currency’s value. Depending on a country’s poli- cies and evolution, a central bank can share some or all of the above functions with other institutions. Its core role has tended to be controlling the money sup- ply and interest rates in order to, first, price stability (constraining inflation to, say, 1–3%) and, second, foster economic growth and employment. Often this has boiled down to tempering the speculative pressures inherent in market economies (“taking away the punch bowl just when the party is getting going” in the words of an American central banker). Central banks either evolved from dominant private banks (e.g. The Bank of England was incorporated in 1694 but officially founded in 1946) or were created by design (Federal Reserve System, established in 1913). The key idea behind a central bank is that money and banking activities must be controlled in the public’s interest. Will Rogers, offering a little humorous hyperbole, quipped: “There have been three great inventions since the beginning of time: fire, the wheel and central banking”.

There are two basic reasons for such institutional aloofness. First, since central banks have virtually unlimited power to increase the money supply, it would be too tempting for governments to use them as a vehicle to finance vote-getting expenditures through the sale of treas- ury bills to the central bank. While the resulting inflation would be equiva- lent to a ‘tax on cash holdings’, it might be more palatable and less transparent than direct taxation or expenditure restraint. Thus central bank independence encourages governments to show fiscal discipline. Deficits will be more con- strained by what capital markets are prepared to finance. Second, in defending sound money i.e. guarding against inflation, central banks may well be forced to take politically unpopular actions such as letting interest rates increase which will in turn slow down over-heated economies. While this is in economy’s long run best interests, in the short run many economic players may suffer. A gov- ernment responsive to its electorate would be less able to resist the political pressure to compromise the long run goal of price stability in return for ‘buying’ the short term popularity in the eyes of the voting public. Yet how to achieve accountability for what, after all, is a creature of the national interest? This is typically done through a combination of a governing charter and appointment of an independent governing council. While central banks are designed to focus exclusively on inflation-fighting, they are not immune to public pressures, es- pecially during times of financial crisis. Indeed, since their very independence gives them the power to act without going to the bother of seeking a politi- cal consensus, there is even more pressure to do something! In the aftermath of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, several central banks decided to provide a helping hand to the private sector with <i>quantitative easing</i>. In the EU, there was an absence of a decisive crisis response from gridlocked political leaders. The European Central Bank has come under enormous pressure to fill the gap. Over 2010–2011, the ECB bought up €160 billion in Greek, Irish, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish bonds to ease pressure on the bloc’s weakest members (ref: article quoted below). Yet the principle of central bank independence is held to be sacred by many. Despite the risks of an EU financial <i>meltdown</i>, many would not compromise sticking to a strict inflation-fighting mandate. In the words of a high-ranking hard-line ECB official who resigned in protest: “Should I flood the markets only to realise afterwards that the water damage has become bigger than the fire damage?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="191" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3005.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part683.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part685.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
