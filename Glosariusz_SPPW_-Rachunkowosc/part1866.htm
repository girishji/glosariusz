Should it be the <i>accounting regulator </i>who, charged with safeguarding <i>stakeholders, </i>has the most powerful legal authority to protect the public’s welfare? Should it be <i>management </i>who, despite their role as hired agents, are the most familiar with the everyday operations and internal financial details of the entity? While all of these parties collectively have a role, <i>accounting principles </i>and leg- islation in most jurisdictions leave primary responsibility for financial reporting with management. Placing it on such shoulders is largely pragmatic: it would simply be too costly and wasteful to have others do it. Yet in the case of separate ownership, the <i>agency problem </i>kicks in. It suggests that management cannot be blinded trusted to act as its own judge of <i>financial performance, </i>especially if this determines their personal remuneration. For this reason, financial reporting has an <i>institutional infrastructure </i>of “checks and balances” to ensure fidelity to true and fair reporting. That said, “if every- body is responsible then nobody is responsible”. Thus management, as part of their job, is charged with the primary duty. Such a responsibility is formally acknowledged in the <i>annual report </i>in both the <i>management discussion and analysis </i>and the auditor’s <i>opin- ion</i>. As well, some companies include a separate section in their annual report entitled “Management’s Discussion of Financial Responsibility”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:71.6167pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:25pt"><td style="width:55pt" bgcolor="#000000"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:256pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">n’t a Clue</p></td></tr><tr style="height:156pt"><td style="width:311pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt" colspan="2"><p class="s108" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 27pt;padding-right: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The former CEO was paid more than $100 million.
