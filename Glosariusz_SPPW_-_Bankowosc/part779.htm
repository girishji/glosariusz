Typical deal structuring measures are matching <i>repay- ments </i>to cash flow streams or having <i>covenants </i>sensitive to critical operating parameters so the banker is alerted early if something important is amiss. The structuring exercise is often the most creative and satisfying aspect of lending as the banker finds a smart way to meet the contrary objectives of both lender and borrower.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2187"><span class="s22">De-banking </span></a><a href="part580.htm#bookmark1626" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Zwrot licencji bankowej </span>– The voluntary surrender of a <i>bank charter </i>to the regulatory authorities in order to move into business lines (such as insurance, underwriting) that are prohibited to banks. De-banking is primar- ily a phenomenon in the USA where sharp legal barriers prevent the mixing of banking and commercial activities. In the face of <i>disintermediation </i>trends, the value of a bank charter may be less attractive to financial institutions that no longer need to take deposits, make loans or transfer funds.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2188"><span class="s22">Debt Ceiling </span></a><span class="s52">(USA) </span><a href="part406.htm#bookmark1309" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Pułap zadłużenia </span><span class="s32">(USA) </span>– A self-imposed legal limit created in 1917 on how much outstanding debt the US federal government can accumulate. The ceiling is unique to the United States (most countries will let their debts increase automatically when government spending outpaces tax rev- enue) and was designed to create a formal <i>financial discipline </i>on the Federal government’s spending. The ceiling limits deficit spending that is financed by either borrowing money from investors through the issuance of treasury bills/ bonds or borrowing from itself by tapping trust funds set aside by payroll taxes</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">for future social security payments. The need to explicitly raise the ceiling en- sures that government deficits are part of the political system’s consciousness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="110" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3397.png"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 316pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Debt Ceiling (USA) <span class="s27">883</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3398.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="409" height="337" alt="image" src="Image_3399.png"/></span></p><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Debt ceiling</p><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Debt ceiling</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Debt ceiling</p><p style="padding-top: 24pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">That said, its power as a spending constraint has been diluted by a repeated pat- tern of Congressionally-sanctioned increases (10 times since 2001) whenever there is a threat of shutting down government operations.
