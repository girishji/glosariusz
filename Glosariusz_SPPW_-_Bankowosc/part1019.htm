The rise of the euro-dollar market is a benign example. While the global <i>Basel Capital Accords </i>closed this door, its “one-size-fits-all” approach gives banks an incentive to avoid the constraints of capital standards whenever they were out of synch with economic reality. For example, under Basel I, the capital requirements of standardised <i>risk weighted assets </i>could be much different than the expected losses of <i>credit risk quantifica- tion</i>. Thus, a corporate loan with an A+ credit rating required the same 8% capi- tal backing as the loan with, say, a BB- credit rating. Because interest spreads in the market for the better risk were low, a bank either had to accept a low rate of return (in itself not good for building its capital), or it might exit the busi- ness altogether (not good for the market). On the other hand, if the real risk was higher than the regulatory risk then a bank would be tempted to increase its <i>risk appetite </i>if it could get high enough pricing. Either way, the results were perverse in terms of encouraging <i>sound banking systems</i>. RCA comes in many guises. The trick is to minimise the allocation of bank capital in relation to as- set yields. Some manifestations of RCA, which prompted the rise of the <i>shadow</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4445.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Basle I standard lumps all corporate loans into the 8 percent capital bucket, but the banks’ internal capital allocations for individual loans vary considerably – from less than 1 per- cent to well over 30 percent – depending on the estimated riskiness of the position in question.
