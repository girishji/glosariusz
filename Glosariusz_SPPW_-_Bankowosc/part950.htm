In a nutshell, it is any situation where: “If I win, we both win. But if I lose, you lose.” A “classic” example might be the various government safety nets that shield a <i>bank </i>from failure. These are in place to protect the overall financial system. But might bank management be tempted to take risks that, if they succeed, make them look like heroes, but if they fail are lost in the government’s budget? Thus, <i>deposit </i>insurance or a <i>lender of last resort </i>may tempt bankers to be less prudent than they would if they were fully penalised for their errors. Moral hazard is perhaps an inevitable outcome of using <i>other people’s money </i>(to prick their con- science old-school bankers might ask: “would you make this loan if it was your own money and not the bank’s?”). At the shareholder’s level it is kept in check by ensuring that the bank’s capital is fully at risk. While a shareholder’s stake may be modest compared to bank deposits, it is on the frontline to absorb the losses of bad risk-taking. The <i>oversight </i>function of <i>corporate governance </i>will then hope- fully discipline management to act responsibly. This is the essence of bank capital adequacy regulations and bank failure resolutions that are consciously designed</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="158" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4159.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1052 <span class="s28">Moral Hazard (Risk Takers)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4160.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">to wipe out shareholder’s investment, including any banker’s <i>compensation </i>in the form of shares. Furthermore, it needs to be said that the typical commercial bank- er thinks in terms of a life-long career and safeguarding a personal reputation for <i>prudence</i>. Such people do not consciously gamble with their bank’s destiny. Moral hazard is a real concern when staff are rewarded with rich profit-sharing bonuses on <i>proprietary trading</i>. This is often the case in investment banking, hedge funds and private equity funds. Talented traders are often given the incentive of with very high bonuses. There will be a natural temptation to take higher risks that are contrary to the true commercial interests of their employers whose money they are playing with (see quote below). The damage can even spill over into so- ciety at large. In the words of the <b>“</b>Financial Times<b>” </b>newspaper: “The asymmetry of risks and rewards has led to very poor social outcomes. Bankers have ben- efited massively from loading individuals and institutions with unnecessary debt or churning investment portfolios to extract transaction fees.” (ref: <i>Diamond is a bank’s best friend</i>, 4/11/11). There are ways to guard against a risk-taker’s moral hazard. They include such defence mechanisms as deferred compensa- tion schemes, payment in shares (vs. cash) and internal controls that accurate- ly measure and cap exposure to loss. In commercial bankers the <i>credit culture </i>plays a big role. But they are far from perfect. Indeed, although moral hazard in a “natural” behavioural trait, in extremis, it can even encourage fraud when rogue employees circumvent the rules. Contrast to <i>moral hazard (borrowers)</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4161.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bankers get their stellar rewards when investment strate- gies do well yet [have] a floor on their losses when they go bad.
