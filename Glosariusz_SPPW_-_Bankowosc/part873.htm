Collectively, the latter stimulates overall economic activity by transmitting a wealth effect into consumer spending. In poorly developed credit markets, high housing prices will tend to reduce consumer spending (e.g. first time buyers must save more; those who rent must devote more household budget to accommodation). Home equity loans can reverse this tendency by allowing those with surplus home equity to spend more and thus boost overall economic activity. In the words of one pro- motional campaign: “Put your home to work for you!”. The downside for both banks and borrowers is that such asset-based loans can tempt homeowners to over-extend themselves since the lending decision can tend to be decoupled from debt-service capacity. In the USA, a trend in delinquencies told this story (see graph below). The other fatal flaw occurs when housing prices fall. All of a sudden such loans can become very shaky. Moreover, a de-leveraging process depresses economic activity as consumption is curtailed. In the USA, HEL and HELOC portfolios were often securitised into <i>residential mortgage backed security </i>which went on to become the notorious toxic assets during the Credit Crisis of 2007– 2009. Abbreviations for home equity loans became part of the jargon of the capital market (see quote below). To some, a hidden meaning could be also gleaned: HEL stood for “hell” and HELOC stood for “hell locked-in”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3818.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bond market terminology was designed less to convey me- aning than to bewilder outsiders...
