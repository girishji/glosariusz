Considering the size of the $15+ trillion market (2007), scandals are in fact statistically rare. For most market players, quite apart from the strength of their ethical backbone, cheat- ing simply doesn’t pay. Additionally, scandals are probably an inherent side-show of acquisitive human nature. The odd scandal (but only odd) might simply be the price to pay for a robust <i>equity culture </i>that normally operates without a hitch.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5823"><span class="s21">War Bonds </span></a><a href="part526.htm#bookmark1354" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Obligacje wojenne </span><span class="s22">• </span>Government debt issued in times of war to finance military expenditures. War bonds are designed to appeal to people’s pat- riotism. They are often accompanied by promotional campaigns and artistically enhanced with war themes. In WW II, for example, the US treasury raised $185 billion through such specialised <i>treasury bonds</i>. Financing a war by means of bonds, as opposed to income taxes, have interesting political implications. Wars financed by debt are more palatable to voters since they do not see the financial cost of the war immediately hit their pocketbook.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5824"><span class="s21">War Chest </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part1065.htm#bookmark2765" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Zapasy wojenne </span><span class="s48">(żargon) </span><span class="s22">• </span>An exceptionally large, in terms of normal transactional needs, accumulation of <i>cash </i>resources kept on hand for either <i>prudential </i>or <i>speculative </i>motives.

The idea of “war” refers to being able to finance a conflict, such as a bidding war against a competing buyer.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="407" height="296" alt="image" src="Image_7953.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="50" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7954.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2230.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2232.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
