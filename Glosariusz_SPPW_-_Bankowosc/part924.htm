E.g. a pledged cash deposit may not need any margin while receivables, which will be difficult to fully collect, require a more generous margin.

For example, in trading futures, the clearing house will require traders to ‘post’ a margin. Any unrealised profits will increase the account while any losses will decrease it (subject to maintaining a certain pre-agreed minimum balance in relation to the trading position). Legally, the cash is the property of the deposit- ing party and would be disclosed as “restricted cash”. However, by agreement, the clearing house has strong rights of set-off and can grab the cash to satisfy any un- funded trading liabilities.
