Legally and morally, they are obliged to get a fair price for the asset since the borrower has a legitimate vested interest in preserving his/her property value. To the extent that there is a surplus above the lender’s exposure and costs, it belongs to the pledging party; to the extent that there is a shortfall, the borrower must make up the difference in the case of a full <i>recourse </i>loan. At the same time, inherent in its <i>creditor rights</i>, a bank has a right to sell even if at distressed price. In practice, this means that sale proceeds seldom match fair value (see quote below). The amount of value destruction that a court of law might sanction is a matter of degree. A bank is typically obliged to at least use its best efforts (e.g. obtain a valuation,</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">publicly disclose a sale, use an auction process etc.) to look out for the debtor’s interest. To avoid the inherent <i>conflict in interest </i>in play, borrowers can always manage a property sale themselves and voluntarily prepay the debt.
