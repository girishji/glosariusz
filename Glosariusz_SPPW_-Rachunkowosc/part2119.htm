Why pay somebody for leaving early? The logic for severance pay may be positive or negative. It can be a reward for past work well done, perhaps as defined in a perfor- mance bonus plan. In the case of a <i>CEO </i>who delivers superior share price performance for shareholders, this is an equitable sharing of the spoils of <i>wealth creation</i>. When staff are let go because they are no longer needed, payments are referred to as <i>redundancy payments</i>. The reason for dismissal (breach of rules, job performance, economic reasons, voluntary departure or arbitrary motives etc.), will have a bearing on the predictability and amount of payment. In the case of senior <i>management </i>with employment contracts, severance is equivalent to a penalty for employer’s breach of contract. Severance is not usually paid if the employee is incompetent or fired for “cause” (dishonesty, breaking important rules etc.). Severance pay raises some accounting issues. A common and expedient accounting for such costs is simply to recognise the expense and liability if and when it occurs i.e. when staff is asked to leave. An alternative would be to treat termination benefits, similar to <i>pension benefits</i>, as integral to employment costs and accrue the expense in advance. While it would not apply to each employee, it could be accrued on a pooled basis (i.e. knowing that it will likely have to let go, say, 5% of its staff, a firm might anticipate the expense accordingly). See also <i>restructuring charges </i>and <i>big bath</i>. Severance payments also raise ethical concerns over fairness. Too little a payment leaves vulnerable staff “out in the cold” after years of loyal service. Too much payment, especially to high profile individuals, seems perverse when other stakeholders are hurt- ing. For instance, in 2002, it was revealed that Percy Barnevik, former CEO of the Swiss- Swedish concern ABB, had received an undisclosed severance payment, characterised as a “performance bonus”, of $78 million in 1996 (“BusinessWeek Magazine”, 4 March 2002, pp. 20–21). The secrecy and size of the award, especially in the face of ABB’s poor stock-market performance after his departure, caused a considerable stir and pressure to give it back.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark5211"><span class="s22">Sex (&amp; Accountants) </span></a><a href="part773.htm#bookmark1906" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Seks (i księgowi) </span><span class="s23">•</span>The best we can come up with: “accountants make lots of entries, most of them in the <i>books”</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:85.7903pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:25pt"><td style="width:55pt" bgcolor="#000000"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:256pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">usy Being Good</p></td></tr><tr style="height:85pt"><td style="width:311pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt" colspan="2"><p class="s108" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 27pt;padding-right: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The [accountant’s] high ethical standard is expected and usually found, for it is seldom we see reported in the press a falling by the wayside of those practising his art (or is it science?) and that may be one possible reason why he has remained outside the realms of <span class="s109">romance</span>!</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 109pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">W.S.
