It was established in 2006 to consolidate the oversight of pension and securities trading (see [<i>Polish</i>] <i>Securities and Exchange Commission </i>[<i>KPWiG</i>]/<i>Poland</i>) and expanded in 2008 to include banking regu- lation and supervision. KNF’s mandate is both broad and deep. It is partly a consumer watchdog protecting the interests of market actors. It also acts to en- sure the smooth operation of capital markets through orderly trading and transparency of those tapping the markets. Collectively, these promote the con- fidence in both the capital markets and financial institutions needed for a healthy financial sector. The KNF’s establishment was not without its contro- versy. Existing regulators were credited with doing their job well. In the case of the banking system, 75% of assets were backstopped by strong global players who were presumably already adequately regulated and ready to assist their subsidiaries in any crisis. Thus, there were the (perhaps inevitable) suspicions that tinkering with a good thing was more politically motivated than pruden- tial. Moreover, the temptation for regulators to interfere with the operation of healthy free markets in the name of exercising authority might well be exacer- bated when a super-regulator the likes of KNF is endowed with even more pow- ers. So why construct a super-regulator? Integrating regulation under one roof has both advantages and disadvantages. The primary advantage is in better dealing with ubiquitous systematic risk and avoiding isolated administrative “silos” (and cracks for dangers to fall between). In this regard, the KNF can point to Britain’s <i>Financial Services Authority </i>as being a respected precedent. A disadvantage is the loss of healthy diversification and even a failsafe overlap that an American system might boast. Multiple regulators also help prevent “regula- tory capture” whereby cozy relations between a single regulator and the regu-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="224" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_5521.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1549.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1551.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
