Even economies otherwise fully committed to the free market might justify suspending the <i>right to fail doctrine </i>if an expedient argument could be made about the public’s interest. After all, many government expenditures (e.g. education, health care, defence etc.) are made to cover ‘market failures’. In the case of the banking industry, government rescues of <i>too-big-to-fail </i>banks can be rationalised by the need to avoid <i>contagion </i>and systematic <i>panic</i>. Apart from the cost to the public treasury (which often must be covered by higher taxes), socialising the losses of banks imposes another cost. The precedent can lead to <i>moral hazard </i>amongst others in the future. Bank shareholders may well know that they will pay a crippling price since they are typically wiped out by govern- ment rescues. But individual bankers working for an aggressive bank – espe- cially one with imperfect <i>corporate governance </i>– are a different story. They can stand to make fortunes from bonuses if their imprudent gambles pay off. For bankers, the behavioural consequences of risking failure are so lopsided that bank rescues can benefit them as much, or even more, than the public who foot the bill (see quote below). Politically, this is repugnant to the public. Not sur- prisingly, after the many rescues necessitated by the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, a wide-spread backlash of against socialising losses is sparking a determination to somehow avoid them in the future.
