Thus the underwriter is, in effect, acting as a “bridge” between an issuer and the buyer, whether they are long term investors or opportunistic traders. For example, an <i>investment bank </i>might take up the shares of an <i>initial public offering </i>and then, utilising its connections in the market (e.g. brokers and permanent inves- tors), distribute the shares far and wide (making it more digestible for the market to absorb). Or, a <i>commercial bank </i>might make a large corporate or sovereign loan that is too much to bear on its own with the intention of syndicating it out to other lend- ers later on. Profits on such transactions are earned through “underwriting spreads” (see below) of the buy-sell price difference. It is quite possible that the underwritten investment is so temporary that it is more like a commission–earning service than a trading transaction. However, an underwriter always faces the risk of being “stuck” with a position that the market doesn’t want, at least at the price offered. The bank is either forced to reduce the price and forfeit its spread in order to “move” the secu- rity or hold onto a position in the hopes market prospects will improve later on. As well, often an underwriter is compelled to hold onto at least a portion of the invest- ment as proof of its confidence in the security (the market saying: “if it’s such a bargain why don’t you invest?”). The primary value-added from underwriting comes from <i>signalling</i>: a respected player is bold and well-informed enough to “step up to the plate”. There is also an issue with <i>due diligence</i>; the market needs to know that somebody has taken a good look at the issuer. This, in turn, tends to make the subsequent sell-down self-fulfilling. Investors say to themselves: “Well, if it’s good enough for a Goldman Sachs or a J.P. Morgan Chase (or whoever), it’s good enough for us”. The underwriting function also includes other ancillary, reenforcing services such as valuation and giving advice on the timing, structure and pricing of an issue. The alternative to underwriting is sell securities to the capital markets directly. While this might be feasible for well-known issuers, the advantages (reference cer- tainty of funds raised, speed of access to the market, etc.) of an underwritten deal are so manifest that most large chunks of capital are raised through an underwriting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">During the bubble years there was enough new high-margin activity – equity underwriting, high-yield debt, and M&amp;A – to make up for [shrinking margins].
