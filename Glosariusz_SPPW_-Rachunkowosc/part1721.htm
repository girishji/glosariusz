A classic example would be employing <i>mark-to-market </i>accounting for a financial instrument hedging an item that is carried at historical cost. While it might be a prudent hedge, unsympathetic accounting will portray more volatility in earnings. (This is why hedge accounting is less necessary the more fair value is being used on the balance sheet.) Accordingly, in the case of a hedge of a balance sheet item (a “fair value hedge”), hedge accounting will defer income statement recognition of any <i>unrealised </i>gain or loss on a financial instrument. It will carry them forward as balance sheet amounts and later incorporate them as adjustments to the measurement of the hedged item’s income state- ment realisation. Hedged transactions (a “cash flow hedge”), will be similarly dealt with. For example, payments and receipts under an interest rate swap are treated as adjust- ments to interest expense (as opposed to showing the financial instrument’s cash flow as an isolated event). While hedging has benign goals, it can confuse (why is the company’s <i>performance </i>different than the market’s?) and even alarm (might the company be specu- lating?!) <i>financial statement </i>readers. In the case of hedging techniques that use financial instruments, readers must be able to relate the <i>off-balance sheet </i>situation to whatever <i>balance sheet </i>or <i>income statement </i>item that is being hedged. Should any gains or losses on financial instruments be reported separately (thus flagging their existence) or be buried in the hedged item (as is the commercial purpose of the hedge)? Other hedging issues include disclosure of the contractual nature, valuation and credit risk of financial instruments. Another issue is what <i>internal controls </i>are in place to prudently manage the hedges. Hedge accounting is complex (<i>footnote </i>disclosure can be profuse) and at times controversial (e.g. treatment by USA’s FAS #133 and #138 (which defers #133) compared to <i>IAS #32 </i>&amp; <i>#39</i>). It is an example of accounting trying to catch up with <i>financial innova- tion</i>. Due to a number of high profile corporate losses from derivatives trading, the issues surrounding hedge accounting can be the subject of considerable attention.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4240"><span class="s22">Hedge Book </span></a><a href="part734.htm#bookmark1812" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Rejestr zabezpieczeń przed ryzykiem </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="s26">An </span>accounting <span class="p">record that tracks the </span>market value <span class="p">of an outstanding </span>derivative <span class="p">contract.

The holder is both able and intending to hold the investment to its maturity. This contrasts to an investment that is being actively traded or which is <i>available-for-sale</i>. The distinction is necessary to deal with changes in <i>market values </i>(or <i>fair values </i>if there is no actively traded market) going forward in time. (A bond with a fixed interest coupon will fluctuate in market value with prevailing market interest rates). The <i>carrying value </i>of a traded investment will be <i>marked-to-mar- ket </i>with the changes in <i>market value </i>(i.e. a <i>capital gains/losses</i>) recognized in the income statement.
