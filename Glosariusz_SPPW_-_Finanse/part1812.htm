The roots of the firm go back to the early 1980s (its name is taken from the last sentence in Walden, a book by Henry David Tho- reau; “the sun is but a morning star”) when the mutual fund industry was expe- riencing dramatic growth. Most individual amateur investors in the funds were hungry for easily accessible and cheap information on fund performance amongst a proliferation of choices. The firm developed a simple but useful rat- ing system based on assigning 1–5 stars for performance and risk of a fund. Its Market Barometer is also widely followed. Following this initial success, it grew off other investment related services, many of which are available on its very robust web-site (</a><span style=" color: #1922FB;">www.morningstar.com</span>).

Verb: to give real estate as security for a loan as in “he mortgaged his home to secure bank”. Roots of the word are from the Old French for <i>mort gaige, </i>meaning ‘dead pledge’ because the charge is extinguished either upon repay- ment of the debt or when the asset is sold (in order to clear the title).

Loans would be originated by brokers and commercial banks and then repackaged into tradable securities upon receiving a credit rating. The existence of tangible collateral would normally be expected to reduce their default risk. However, because of shoddy underwriting standards and nervous credit markets during the <i>sub-prime </i>crisis, MBS became synony- mous with tainted securities. So much that in 2008 regulators and central banks were under pressure to play the role of “<i>buyers of last resort</i>” for MBS.<a name="bookmark4729">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4730">Mr Inside/Mr Outside </a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part466.htm#bookmark1201" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Mr Inside/Mr Outside </span><span class="s48">(żargon) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">A </span><span class="s25">venture capitalist’s </span><span class="p">description of the relative talents of entrepreneurial manage- ment team members.
