ART evolved in response to the insurance industry’s capacity limitations and mobilises the capital markets to take a more direct role in providing various forms of protection thus tending to bring about a convergence of insurance and financial markets. Common examples of ART include catastrophe bonds (where principal repayment is forgiven if a defined event occurs), self-insurance through ‘captive’ (or in-house) insurance companies and weather derivatives (cash flows contingent on weather occurrences). ART also could include the use of credit derivatives to transform risks in the credit market. The bank players in ART are mostly confined to large money-centre US Wall Street banks.

An economy with a low level of animal spirits will be reluctant to invest (albeit even if speculatively) and grow. Thus the presence of animal spirits in a market economy is healthy (when suppressed in the midst of an economic slump, Keynes’ prescription was to supplement them by government expenditures). A key player in ‘the jungle’ has traditionally been the profit-seeking <i>entrepreneur </i>(see also <i>Schumpeter </i>and <i>creative destruction</i>) and the speculator. Bankers themselves are not supposed to driven by such acquisitive instincts because of their fiduciary duty of care and the need to be prudent and sound.

AML typically requires banks to invoke the <i>know the borrower </i>rule in order to substantiate the underlying nature of customer transactions. In particular, deposits are scrutinised for their legitimacy (i.e. a result of earned revenue from legal commercial activities). As well, banks are obliged to be on the alert for suspicious activity that might suggest the possibility of money laundering. Examples might include large cash transactions in small denomination bills for a business that normally should operate an open account. If banks merely suspect (vs. actually know about) money laundering, they are obliged by law to report their suspicions to their respective national AML authority for further official investigation. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) is an intergovernmental body designed to coordinate AML in separate countries. While the banking industry obviously does not want to be a complicit participant in criminal activities (even if unknowingly), implementing AML has become controversial due to the burden of its administrative costs in the face of a questionable impact on crime prevention. Moreover, it can be very difficult to detect money laundering in the face of the high transaction volumes that banks handle (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2627.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sometimes, but fortunately not often, one sees reported in the press a case where a bank has been party to the conver- sion [i.e. misuse] of money; a grim and sinister accusation which in no way ascribes dishonesty.
