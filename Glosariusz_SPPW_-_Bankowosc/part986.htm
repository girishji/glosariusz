If only because it is in their interest to avoid another crisis, expect a lot. Arguably many, if not most of the points on the above list have been initiated by banks themselves if only by pass- ing on greater costs to their customers (see quote above). But bank customers are also taxpayers. Compared to the cost of public bailouts, they might be better off by having reliable, albeit more costly, banking relationships.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2765">Postponement (Creditor’s Security) </a><a href="part299.htm#bookmark1120" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part299.htm#bookmark1120" class="s24">Odroczenie (zabezpieczenie </a><span class="s60">kredytodawcy) </span><span class="p">– One secured creditor giving a priority of interest to another</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">secured creditor when they both have a <i>security interest </i>in the same asset. For example, a creditor in first position on a mortgage might postpone to credi- tors in second or third position. Although rare, this could be done because the creditor in first position no longer needs the full protection (perhaps having received a pay-down or alternative collateral security) yet still wants to retain a position on the title (otherwise the security could just be discharged).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4308.png"/></span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2766">Pre-approved Credit </a><a href="part541.htm#bookmark1555" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Wstępna decyzja kredytowa </span><span class="p">– A popular consumer banking product designed to build market share.

Make sure you pay your credit cards each month. If you can- not, then start working towards that goal. We need to bor- row less and use cards less. We need to use more cash. Also need to spend less on useless things that gather dust in our homes. If you have a home already do not sell and borrow to get a larger one. Why? The more debt we have more slaves they get. The more debt you have the longer you will be     a slave. The entire system is designed to keep you buying and working more and more to pay off the debt.
