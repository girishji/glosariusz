They are designed to influence behaviour; not dictate. So long as they are willing to show <i>forbear- ance</i>, banks don’t want to manage but rather compel managers to act (see quote below). For example, while restricted credit may, in itself, do little to solve a deeper problem, it can compel management to take self-help steps, possibly by turnaround. The key to good lending control is assertively taking action, even if it’s unpleasant, when “alarm bells are ringing”. In particular, the firm exercise of control is needed in <i>recovery work out </i>situations. (That said, care must be taken not to usurp management’s legitimate role and thereby become exposed to lender liability.) By trying to salvage uncomfortable situations, lend- ing controls are self-serving (“It’s our money you are dealing with; we want a say in its deployment”). But they also fulfil a broader, valuable economic function, imposing healthy <i>financial discipline </i>on wayward enterprises (“The bank forced to wake up and act; we are the better for it”)<i>.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3170.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">[In recovery work-out situation] banks need a compromise which allows them to veto certain key decisions and influ- ence management’s attitude to others without going so far as to manage the company, with the risks this entails in each country.
