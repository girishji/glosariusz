Typically, the reinsurer is a larger, better-capitalised company than the “front-line” insurance company. The reinsured company can also be re- ferred to as the “original or primary” insurer, the “direct writing company” or the “ceding company” – all reflecting the relationships at work. The industry has its own unique vernacular. Risks are “laid off ” in reinsurance “treaties” that provide “cover”. Protection is subject to “deductibles” before any payment kicks in. Reinsurers tend to cover either an agreed amount of an insurance compa- ny’s risk or any claims above a given threshold. The traditional bane of the in- surance industry – including reinsurance – has been its cyclicality. Competi- tion forces premiums down until “under-writing” losses make the market “tight”. However every time premium rates rise, new capital rushes in, bringing rates down again. In the meantime, large and unexpected losses from such disasters as terrorism, medical malpractice and <i>directors’ and officers’ insurance </i>can wipe out capital. Since the whole point of reinsurer is protection against large catastrophes, “claims” can be substantial. There is even concern that cli- mate change is producing more natural catastrophes. The reinsurance industry is largely unregulated. Rating agencies act as the arbiters of reinsurer’s financial health. While treaty relations tend to operate as an “old-boy” network, they can become embroiled in disputes over payment. The world’s largest reinsurance companies are typically European, with Munich Re and Swiss Re being the big- gest in 2008.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s21">Reinvestment Rate </span><a href="part809.htm#bookmark2085" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Stopa reinwestycji </span><span class="s22">• </span>Proportion of an entity’s after-tax operating income that is reinvested back into the firm as opposed to being paid out in dividends.

For example, if an investor buys a 5 year bond yielding 7% per annum, the interest received may only be reinvested at, say, 5% if interest rates subsequently fall. Thus, while investors can lock in returns on an investment, they cannot lock-in “a return on their return”. Rein- vestment risk is a function of i) interest rate changes (larger declines = higher risk); ii) the size of the cash flows (larger cash flows being reinvested = greater risk) and iii) the timing of the cash flows (early cash flows, such as amortising loans, = higher risk). Reinvestment risk is particularly pronounced if the secu-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="35" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7099.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1997.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1999.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
