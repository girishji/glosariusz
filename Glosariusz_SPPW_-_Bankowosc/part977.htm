He convinced William of Orange <b>– </b>a king hungry for mon- ey to fight the French <b>– </b>to grant an exclusive charter to a <i>private bank</i>. The bank in return would invest in the crown’s debts. The Bank got a reasonable return on its investment. But even more lucrative in the long run was its banking activities financed by <i>banknotes</i>. Paterson suc- ceeded in England with an idea that his fellow countryman, <i>John Law, </i>failed with in France.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pawn Brokering <span class="s27">1077</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="176" height="209" alt="image" src="Image_4282.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="93" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4283.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.myartprints.co.uk/" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;" target="_blank">Source: </a><a href="http://www.myartprints.co.uk/" class="s84" target="_blank">www.myartprints.co.uk</a></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Such success was significant since Britain was largely able to win against France over the years due its stronger finances. The Bank of England would go on to be- come one of the most prestigious banks in the world and evolve into the first <i>cen- tral bank</i>. Paterson went on to promote the ill-fated Company of Scotland, a dis- astrous misadventure to colonise Panama that would end up in “tears, anger and bewilderment” (Davies, p. 571).
