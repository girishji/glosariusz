(Breaking into a bank after hours would be classified as “burglary”). Bank robbery (a.k.a. “hold-up” or “heist”) is one of the boldest of crimes against property. When accompanied by weapons, the criminals put both themselves and innocent bystanders in mortal jeopardy. But it’s a crime with panache. Robbers can make for Hollywood scripts such as “Bonnie and Clyde”. In prisons, bank robbery can earn its perpetrators the respect and even admiration of fellow inmates. Considering their role as depositories of large amounts of currency, banks are a natural target for such crimes. So when asked why he robbed them, the famous (and humorous) retort by the US robber Willie Sutton was reputedly: “Because that’s where the money is.” That said, the crime has its obvious hazards. By design, banks are not easy things to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">rob. Most cash is stored in impregnable bank vaults, usually under a time lock which even staff cannot open. Teller’s cages hold relatively modest cash balances (say, a few hours’ worth of transactions). Front office staff are often ensconced behind bullet-resistant enclosures. Some branches will be protected by armed guards (the US frontier practice of issuing firearms to branch staff is no longer done). Some branches have hidden alarms that can be surreptitiously triggered. Video monitors will often capture a record of the crime (for this reason, most robbers wear masks). The boldest robbers use violent intimidation “Give me what’s in the vault or I’ll do you grievous harm!” This may backfire if victims stand up to them or the robbers don’t have the intestinal fortitude to make good of their threat. For all these reasons, compared to its risks, bank robbery in fact “doesn’t pay”. More than 50% of robbers get apprehended within one day, typically trying to escape in densely secured urban settings. According to the <i>Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics </i>(ref: Wikipedia) injuries occur in about two percent and a death occurs in less than 1% of all US bank robberies. In fact, the majority of bank robberies involve a written note (“note jobs”) slipped to a teller demanding money. Since standard policy in most banks is to avoid violence, tellers will normally hand over the money on the spot. The robber usually gets away with a relatively small amount. In the USA, the average take in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="40" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2811.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part641.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part643.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
