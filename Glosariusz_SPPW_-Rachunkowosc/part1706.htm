While historical cost accounting does not recognise <i>internally generated goodwill</i>, it will do so if a third party is willing to purchase it;</p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">4. The purchaser may be bringing potential synergies to the acquired company and thereby be able to enhance the collective value of the purchased company’s assets. Indeed, assuming that existing management is already maximising shareholder value, the only way to boost value is by bringing something extra “to the table”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Goodwill has traditionally presented accountants with reporting challenges with a diversity of treatment. Many countries favoured an immediate write-off of all good- will; in others, it was more common to capitalise it and then amortise it over time, which in turn had a range of time spans (from 5 years up to 40 years).

Goodwill? He had an opaque face, spots of bright colour in his cheeks, a face from a Flemish military painting. The notary found the relevant paragraph and pointed it out; the two men read it with their index fingers and grunted to confirm their understanding.</p><p class="s113" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Polish Officer <span class="s110">(1995) by Alan Furst, p. 197</span></p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4202"><span class="s22">Goodwill Impairment Test </span></a><a href="part878.htm#bookmark2155" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Test na utratę wartości firmy </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="s26">Goodwill is an </span>unidentifiable <i>intangible asset </i>whose <i>carrying value </i>is subject to a relatively high poten- tial for over-valuation and/or doubts about its value. Goodwill’s vulnerability could be due to an over-priced acquisition bid or post-acquisition performance that is below original expectations.

Under IFRS, this is accomplished by dividing an acquired company into <i>cash generating units </i>and then allocating total goodwill amongst the CGUs. The <i>recoverable amount </i>of a CGU (measured by the <i>present value </i>of its future cash flows) is then compared to the carrying value of assets, including allocated goodwill, within each CGU.
