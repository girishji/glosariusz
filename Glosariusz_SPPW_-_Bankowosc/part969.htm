Companies use other people’s money, either be- cause they lack sufficient capital themselves or because people, having neither the know-how nor time to employ their own capital productively, are willing to give it to others to manage on their behalf. A classic instance of employing other people’s money is in banking where, based on public confidence, institu- tional reputation and government regulation, large amounts are left on <i>deposit </i>compared to a relatively modest equity base. While other people’s money is the essence of the capital market, the phrase’s usage is often in conjunction to con- cerns about the agency problem as in, for example: “the care and safety of one’s own money is more important compared to other people’s money”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4250.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The directors of such companies, being the managers of <b>other people’s money </b>rather than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the sa- me anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private co-partnery frequently watch over their own.

Over-rides, whether conscious or not (the latter being even more dangerous since there is little aware- ness of the exception being taken), are perhaps an inevitable part of working in the real world (see quote below). However, many a sound bank, with a good credit policy, has gotten into trouble by ignoring its own lending standards for some “special” client. The best way to deal with the inevitable temptation to be “flexible” with credit rules is to identify when over-rides are occurring so their merits can be re-considered and at least confirmed, typically by a higher level of <i>credit au-</i></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">thority<span class="p">. Over-rides should seldom occur. If there are too many of them, it is strong evidence that the credit policy, or the over-ride habit, needs to be re-thought.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="55" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4252.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part968.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part970.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
