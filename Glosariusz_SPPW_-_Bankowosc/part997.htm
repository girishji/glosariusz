In bad times, funding will be reined in dramatically, leading to a self-reinforcing downward spiral in economic activity (and fur- ther withdrawals of finance). In the case of banks, this swing in psychologi- cal sentiments was traditionally known as the <i>credit cycle. </i>Pro-cyclicality in- cludes such factors as the role of prudential regulations. For example, if more regulatory capital is required in downturns, banks will be forced to de-leverage and curtail lending. Matters are made worse than they need be. After the near- death experience of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, financial system reform- ers are seeking ways to dampen pro-cyclicality. One such measure is to take a complete-cycle perspective on the level of minimum capital. In good times, an excess of regulatory capital should ideally be built up as a buffer for the inevita- ble bad times (with the excess capital requirements temporarily relaxed during economic contractions).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2791"><span class="s22">Prolonged/Protracted Default </span></a><a href="part393.htm#bookmark1287" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part393.htm#bookmark1287" class="s24">Przedłużające/utrzymujące się narusze- </a><span class="s60">nie warunków umowy </span>– A situation where a loan or credit has been overdue for an extended period of time without resolution through settlement<i>, </i>collec-</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tion or enforcement. In theory, any debtor in default will be subject to pressure to pay through the exercise of <i>creditor’s rights</i>. However, often debtors can avoid paying by disputes, denying evidence of indebtedness, hiding or court proceed- ings. Another cause of prolonged default is laxity by the creditor in collection procedures. In general, the longer an overdue debt has been outstanding, the less likely it will ever be collected.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2792"><span class="s22">Promissory Note </span></a><a href="part521.htm#bookmark1520" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Weksel własny </span>– A legal document in which the borrower formally acknowledges and promises to repay their debt. This is necessary to con- firm the obligation and avoid a denial that there ever was a loan as is the case with a chose in action. Promissory notes are an useful inheritance from English banking practice which developed extensive laws surrounding the endorsement (ownership transfer) and use of promissory notes as units of exchange/financ- ing means. In modern circumstances, they have lost some of their significance. <i>Deposit </i>account agreements, undisputed bank statements and bank records all combine to substantiate the existence of debt. Other parties signing a promissory note give the lender extra recourse: an “endorser” will pay if the primary borrower defaults; a “co-maker’s” obligation is joint and several (the lender can get payment from either or both) and a “co-signer’s” obligation is limited to a specified share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="146" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4334.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part996.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part998.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
