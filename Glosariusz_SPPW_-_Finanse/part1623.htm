In particular, for almost three years prior to 2007, global GDP grew at an annualized rate of more than 4% for 11 consecu- tive quarters. This strong burst of sustained growth was achieved with histori- cally mild inflation despite the tripling of oil prices after 2003. Such a fortuitous state of affairs was attributed to a combination of wise fiscal and monetary poli- cies as well as globalisation tending to smooth out regional business cycles. This in turn seemed to foretell lower <i>volatility </i>and, because compensating risk pre- miums are lower, higher prices in most financial markets. In all, these were the ingredients of swelling overconfidence. Alas, as of the writing of this compen-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">dium (2009), the Great Moderation has proved to be a delusional example of collective hubris. The <i>Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 </i>quickly pricked a massive fi- nancial <i>bubble </i>that ushered in a nasty global recession. The <i>business cycle </i>is still with us and government policy-makers need to “go back to school”, especially learning their lessons in <i>financial regulation</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4236"><span class="s21">Greenfield Project </span></a><a href="part301.htm#bookmark771" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Inwestycja od podstaw </span><span class="s22">• </span>Any <i>capital expenditure </i>involv- ing the construction of new facilities from scratch as in converting pasture land.

Hence, it is a kind of blackmail employing (green) money. Since green- mail is not fair to the rest of the shareholders it is now banned in most corporate charters and laws. Greenmail was a popular tactic of <i>corporate raiders </i>who chal- lenged incumbent management to do a better job in creating value for share- holders. While now seen as an “odious practice” (“Fortune” (Europe), June 11, 2007, p. 66), it was perhaps a useful step in the evolution to better <i>shareholder activism</i>.
