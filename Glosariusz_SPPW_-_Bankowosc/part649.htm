In the meantime, damage – in the form of job losses, crimped business activity and value destruction – is usually wrecked upon the rest of the economy. Since, by design and operation, banks are supposed to be reliably sound, banking cri- ses are scary but mercifully rare. That said, the IMF (ref: <i>Bank Soundness and Macroeconomic Policy</i>, 1997) has estimated that about 75% of its 130 member countries have experienced banking sector problems since 1980 (see map). None were life-threatening until the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 which brought some countries to the brink of 1930s Depression-era fears. The pattern in most</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">bank crises is all too familiar (see quote below from more than 150 years ago) but confoundedly hard to avoid. It tends to start benignly with ‘good times’. Banks respond to market pressures (both their own and from their customers)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="86" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2828.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">750<span class="s53"> </span><span class="s28">Banking Crisis</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">to support growth. This facilitates prosperity and creates wealth. But hidden risks can go undetected (“confidence is the feeling you get when you don’t fully understand the situation”) and, compelled by otherwise healthy competition, they over-extend. A lending boom creates asset bubbles that burst as financial reality sinks in. The financial losses of failed borrowers must be absorbed by their lenders (that’s what <i>credit risk </i>is all about). If the resultant <i>bank losses </i>are severe enough, their solvency is perhaps questioned. A loss of confidence, fuelled by <i>contagion</i>, precipitates a mass exodus of immediately repayable ‘on demand’ funding sources. Thus a profitability problem morphs into a solvency problem which in turn morphs into a liquidity problem. For the sake of the public’s welfare, governments are then compelled to step in to rescue the bank system (see <i>too big to fail doctrine)</i>. In all, it is a monumental mess (“broken lives, lost homes and workers whose skills and confidence have gone” – “The Economist”, 14/5/11). But it makes banking ‘interesting’.
