If more investors can be attracted, the fund will grow by expanding its portfolio. If investors want their money back, the fund will liqui- date investments, redeem shares and shrink. In the meantime, the value of the shares of the fund is calculated based on the <i>net asset value </i>of the underlying investments. This contrasts to <i>closed end investment fund </i>that never has to re- deem its shares. Open-end funds are appealing to investors who do not want to be exposed to the market risk of a traded security. However, selling pressure on share prices can arise from high levels of <i>redemptions </i>(i.e. if a large volume of investors want their money back, the resultant asset sales will tend to depress</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">prices in the fund). As well, fund managers will not leverage open-ended fund assets with debt for fear of having to redeem assets. The yield-enhancing ben- efits of leverage are thus forgone. The most common open-ended fund is a <i>mutual fund</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4837"><span class="s21">Open Interest </span></a><a href="part575.htm#bookmark1477" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Otwarte pozycje </span><span class="s22">• </span>The number of outstanding contracts in a <i>futures </i>market that have not been exercised, closed out or allowed to expire.
