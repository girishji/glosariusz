The term tends to be used rather casually by bankers. Its simplest usage would relate solely to various levels of risk. Thus a credit card portfolio with, say, 5% losses would be described as have ‘low quality’ compared to a residential mortgage portfolio with losses of, say, 0.5%. A more refined sense is the certainty of inherent <i>credit risk </i>in a loan portfolio. While loans have fixed contractual amounts (e.g. the face value of promissory notes), the full repayment of both interest and principal in the future is never taken for granted. Banks typically expect to lose some money as an unavoidable ‘cost of doing business’ (see <i>risk costs</i>). Knowing this, they will try to quantify</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">a degree of risk and price credit accordingly so as to be compensated for the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">risks they assume they are taking. Thus high risk is not bad per se if it is fully compensated by price (via a <i>risk premium </i>on interest). But risk quantification might turn out to be wrong (risk is not the same as uncertainty). Ex post (after the fact), credit quality could be precisely measured by unexpected losses. If un- expected losses were modest in relation to expected losses then bankers could say that the credit quality was ‘good’. A SME portfolio with expected losses of, say, 2%, is acceptable whereas it would be terrible for a <i>corporate lending credit </i>portfolio. Ex ante, before the fact, credit quality is the degree of certainty that risk is accurately known. Like most qualitative attributes, credit quality is dif- ficult to quantify in advance. Some of the criteria that could be used:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">the analytical robustness of the risk quantification model</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">past history that went into quantifying the risk; the more experience,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">and knowledge gained, the better</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">resiliency to adverse change by sensitivity analysis (individual borrowers)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s23">◆ </span>or <i>stress test</i>ing (portfolio)</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">concentrations within a portfolio; more diversified portfolios allow</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">a better regression to a mean</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">the more ‘repayment redundancy’ (second, third way out), the better.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="64" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3314.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part757.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part759.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
