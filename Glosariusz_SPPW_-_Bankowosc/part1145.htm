Lenders also are careful to confirm the borrowing authority of an enterprise’s officers or directors, typically by ob- taining a legal opinion. In some countries (e.g. the UK), they are also protected by the indoor management rule that allows outsiders to rely on a company’s representatives if the circumstances are reasonable.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3207"><span class="s22">Volcker Rule </span></a><a href="part420.htm#bookmark1333" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Reguła Volckera </span>– A bold but popular financial reform advocated by the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve who was later appointed to advise the US government on how to avoid another Credit Crisis of 2007– 2009. In a throwback to the draconian <i>Glass-Steagall Act</i>, government insured deposit-taking banks would be banned by the Frank-Dodd reforms from <i>pro- prietary trading </i>and could have only limited involvement in hedge or private equity funds. In Volcker’s view the government safety net from the <i>too big to fail doctrine </i>constituted an implicit – and potentially dangerous – subsidy of specu- lative proprietary trading. This in turn can corrupt a healthy corporate cultural within a bank: “A commercial bank has clients who look out for the long-term interest of the client. [When] you’re out there trading and paying your guys zillions of dollars for successful trading, it affects the whole culture of the in-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_5020.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">stitution in a way that is destabilising” (<i>Volcker defends his ‘rule’ from critics</i>, <b>“</b>Financial Times”, 26/10/11). Privately, many <i>money centre </i>bankers argue that Volcker is “barking up the wrong tree” (i.e. the root causes of problems lie else- where), few are willing to publicly stand up to such a respected elder statesman of finance. Volker has publically praised <i>Canadian banks </i>for their soundness and involvement in the residential mortgage market. Volcker never participated in the “Occupy Wall Street” movement of 2011. But his rule is likely to have a greater impact on the US financial sector than any angry street protests ever will.
