Another complica- tion with profit maximization is the nature of the financial reporting model that measures profit. As an accounting figure, profit is subject to many <i>accounting estimates </i>and can even be manipulated (compared to the concrete reality of cash flow). Finally, those who favour the <i>stakeholder </i>model would argue that there are other priorities besides profit (e.g. <i>corporate social responsibility</i>) that de- serve attention. That said, warts and all, profit maximization is the most legiti- mate single measure of competitive performance, albeit not the only one. First, profit maximization has the most capability to be consistent with wealth maxi- misation (adjusted for the <i>time value of money</i>, cumulative accounting profits will equal cumulative net cash flow over the life of the firm). Second, profits measure the actual past track record of the enterprise without any need for in- herently subjective and unreliable future estimations required by NPV.

Thus the buyer strives to acquire the best product at the lowest price while the seller strives to sell the cheapest product at the highest price. When they find a mutually acceptable compromise, a transac- tion occurs. In competitive free markets, the profit motive is strong enough to override personal considerations. Thus the market is “impersonal”. The profit motive is at the heart of the <i>theory of the firm </i>and ultimately governs all com- mercial relationships. While many might bemoan it as greedy, uncharitable, selfish, etc., it is both “natural” and, if channelled into productive uses, im- mensely productive for all concerned. Accountants are the handmaidens of the profit motive because it is their job to accurately measure the thing that every- body is chasing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="119" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_6916.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Daily Bread</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Daily Bread</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Daily Bread</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1946.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1948.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
