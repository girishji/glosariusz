From the banking industry’s perspective, prevention and losses from bank robbery are a ‘cost of doing business’ and are absorbed as an operating expense (vs. being covered by insurance). The other issue is restoring staff morale after the trauma of experiencing an armed robbery or kidnapping. Finally, in the aftermath of the backlash against <i>bad bankers</i>, there may be worse transgressions than holding up a bank. As the play write Bertolt Brecht tells us in his <i>Threepenny Opera </i>(1928): “What is robbing a bank compared to owning a bank?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="421" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2812.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All his reflections and speculations inevitably led to the one conclusion: he must get his hands on a large sum of money, if not legally, then by theft.

A basic distinction is between <i>commercial bankers </i>who are engaged lending relationships and <i>invest- ment bankers </i>who are engaged in trading transactions in the capital markets. Not everybody who works in a <i>bank </i>necessarily sees themselves as a “banker”. For example, tellers<i>, </i>clerks and head office technical specialists may not identify with the description (they would rather just say that they ‘work in a bank’). While bankers typically possess commercial common sense and will have a liking and a talent in the financial arts, they will not necessarily share the <i>ani- mal spirits </i>of the entrepreneur (see quote below).
