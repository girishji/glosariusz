Since value is a function of benefits relative to costs, to offer a “value proposition”, a bank has to be both efficient to keep costs and pricing low while at the same time deliver a superior competitive offer. While the term tends to be consultant’s jargon, it has a very legitimate point, which is to understand what motivates bank clients in order to concentrate on satisfying them. For example (see graph below), retail customers tend to value personal service and convenience; they are relatively insensitive to fees, prices and a bank’s soundness. Wholesale customers tend to take an opposite approach; they are price sensitive and tend to be cautious. Delivering an attractive value proposition to each segment will require very differ- ent approaches. Business process re-engineering pays particular attention to the value chain in order to pin-point opportunities for efficiency improvement. Often this in- volves investing in IT systems (see quote below). Any step, process or party that ap- pears to have only a modest contribution to ultimate buyer satisfaction is a candidate for re-engineering or even elimination. When banks outsource activities to third par- ties it typically reflects a value chain analysis i.e. avoid low value activities in order to concentrate on core competencies. A “classic” manifestation of the value chain in lend- ing is perhaps <i>securitisation</i>. Banks add the most value by originating loans, servicing loan portfolios and building customer relationships through <i>cross-selling. </i>Low value, commodity-like funding activities are better placed with capital market investors.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4995.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Financial institutions are under pressure to expand their business volumes while maintaining or reducing the cost of transactions.
