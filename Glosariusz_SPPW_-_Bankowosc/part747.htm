But they soon began to obey the ‘law of unintended consequences’ to become tainted. Despite some volume shrinkage of late, they are still popular ($50+ trillion notional value) and have a dominant role in the credit derivative market (see graphs below). As the CDS market evolved, its hedging role became increasingly paralleled by a speculative role. The transformation was evolution- ary. The cash flow streams of a CDS had a fair value. They thus could be priced and traded although in a hedging transaction they were held to maturity. When market players had conflicting views of risk (e.g. a CDS price for AAA debt would be different than A debt) a secondary market soon developed. Profits could then be realised on the changing perceptions of risk. Thus, an unexpected downgrade would increase the value of a CDS held by a protection buyer since the probability of default, and hence payment, was higher. In this way, and for the first time in financial history, CDSs allowed debt to be shorted in the same way equities could be shorted (for related entries on <i>short selling</i>, see the <i>Compendium of Finance</i>). If a speculator thought a credit rating was too high, they could ‘put their money where their mouth was’ and buy <i>credit protection </i>cheaply. When the market (or rating agencies) ‘caught up’ to the need for a downgrade, CDS investors could make an immediate trading profit (versus having to actually wait for a default to get paid by the protection seller). Thus, counter-parties might short someone</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="255" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3271.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">852 <span class="s28">Credit Default Swap (Speculative Instrument)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">else’s loan exposure if they thought that the credit risk was badly misjudged. This speculative element in CDS is not, in itself, a bad thing. Like all robust markets, speculators, including short sellers, bring liquidity, discipline and healthy doses of reality to the market, especially in times of irrational exuberance. That said, short selling in any market has a stigma because profits are earned if, and indeed only, when others are suffering (see quote below). Some very brave, shrewd and daring speculators made immense amounts of money using CDSs to short the US housing market during its bubble which peaked in 2005–2006. This, in itself, was bound to stir backlashes from the ‘other side’ that was hurting. However, the real problem with CDSs was their collective impact on the financial system’s systemat- ic risk. Since the CDS market was entirely unregulated its overall status in terms of “who is protecting/betting on whom” was not transparent. Indeed, it is impossible to see what portion of the market is hedging and what portion is speculating. No one, certainly not the regulators, knew where the risk was ultimately going. Mul- tiple bets on the same reference asset could mean counter-parties paying many times over for the same single default. This tended to amplify volatility in the mar- kets since one default would be magnified into many. <i>Fair value accounting </i>rules (see the <i>Compendium of Accounting</i>) for the speculative-type CDSs generated greater income statement volatility and tended to spook nervous markets. What is more, a CDS market is constantly gauging the broader market’s perception of an entity’s default risk. While this ‘signalling’ is perhaps a useful feedback mecha- nism, the hyper-activity can magnify fears if markets are edgy. Other, and scarier, unintended consequences of speculative CDSs abounded as market conditions worsened in the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009. If the credit rating of a protection seller was downgraded, cash collateral provisions were triggered which could put immense and sudden liquidity pressure on the protection seller. This forced the US Treasury to rescue a downgraded AIG (see the related entry in the <i>Compen- dium of Finance</i>). In extremis, CDS even encouraged financially perverse incen- tives. For example, by purchasing a material amount of a firm’s debt in conjunc- tion with a disproportionately large number of CDS contracts, rapacious lenders (mostly hedge funds) made a firm’s bankruptcy more attractive than its solvency. Or prudent lenders who hedged their credit exposure through a CDS may make higher returns from CDS payouts than from out-of-court restructuring plans that could save companies and jobs. The ‘kiss of death’ for CDSs was their integral role in the collateralised debt obligations (CDO) of providing extra assurance that the highly-rated tranches of a CDO would be immune to default. The CDO mar- ket exploded into trillion dollar levels in the bubble-like conditions leading up to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Thus CDSs became intimately associated with what turned out to be toxic assets. Finally, the complexity of CDSs made them appear as ‘financial alchemy’.
