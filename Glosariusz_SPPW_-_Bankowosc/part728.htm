These can easily be ‘moth- erhood’ statements crafted by the investor relations people. In the wake of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, a position on bank’s board is a particularly serious responsibility. Directors must be accomplished business people. They must de- vote time and energy to the position. They need to be pro-actively engaged and willing to pose hard questions to the chief executive and fellow directors. They must act forcefully and exercise their duties. They are not token figureheads. While the board may not literally be able to ‘run’ a bank, they are like “internal regulators” where the compliance objective is stakeholder interests. In the end, a lot of confidence in the effectiveness of bank corporate governance has to be taken on faith in the integrity and competence of the directors themselves. Being a bank director confers a great deal of prestige. It is the earthly Valhalla of a business career. People so graced have a lot to lose. They can hopefully be counted to preserve reputations by conscientiously fulfilling their duties.

It is a matter of perception by both lender and borrower. Since “size counts” in busi- ness, a roster of big name corporate clientele was the envy of most banks. While lending to any business enterprise shares many common attributes (e.g. assess competitive and financial viability, identify a repayment source, have a second way out etc.), corporate clients are distinctive in several ways:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">greater transparency from credit ratings, financial reporting (audited numbers; quarterly reports), financial press coverage, stock exchange disclosure and securities research</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="p">more sophisticated financial management due to the activities of professional staff (MBAs, CAs, CPAs, CFAs) in their finance</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and treasury functions (finance directors/chief financial officers)</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="p">a wider and deeper appetite for financial products and services beyond plain vanilla loans including cash management, foreign exchange trading, hedging and derivatives etc</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="p">demanding levels of service from dedicated account managers and often including attention from the bank’s top management (see quote below)</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="p">because they can tap either the capital markets (via bonds or commercial paper) or other banks (including global players) corporate borrowers</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are less dependent on a <i>house bank</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">These can be mixed blessings. Their pricing is typically very fine (margins are measured in <i>basis points</i>) and can only be justified by very low default risk and economies of scale on the cost side. More stringent capital adequacy rules can make a satisfactory return on capital elusive. When a corporate borrower does default (and they sometimes do) a bank will feel much more pain (see <i>concen- tration risk</i>). Banks deal with these challenges by portfolio risk management techniques such as syndicated lending, secondary loan market sell-downs and credit derivatives (to spread risks). In all, while the high-profile corporate client can seem glamorous, ‘corporates’ are the root cause of <i>disintermediation. </i>The long term trend is a diminishing market for increasingly retail-oriented com- mercial banks (see graph below). The other way to service the corporate sector is by having an investment banking unit within a <i>universal bank </i>(for example, Scotia Capital attends to “long standing relationships with corporate, govern- ment and institutional clients”; Scotiabank Annual Report (2008), p. 10).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="117" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3184.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part727.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part729.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
