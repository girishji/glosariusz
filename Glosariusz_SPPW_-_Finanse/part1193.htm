The existence of <i>bubbles</i>, for example, suggests that markets are not getting it right all the time. Could the irrationality of investors undermine faith in efficient markets? Not necessarily if, in aggregate, individual choices are collectively smart (See <i>wisdom of crowds</i>). Behavioural economics goes beyond capital mar- kets into the economy at large. It could also have profound implications for government intervention and regulation since a laissez-faire attitude, based on a faith in the markets’ rationality, might not be able to work as well as thought.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">In his Nobel acceptance speech, Akerhof used <span class="s30">behavioural economics </span>to criticise over-simplified laissez-faire theories.
