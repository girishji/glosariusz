Capital markets and financial institutions are big enough that they can afford to be more “risk neutral” i.e. accept greater degrees of risk if suitably compensated. Some market participants e.g. hedge funds, venture capitalists etc. (see entries in the <i>Compendium of Finance</i>) are hungry for risk and are often happy to speculate. The business model (see <i>bank earnings formula</i>) for intermediating banks must be more cautious. It tolerates a degree, but only a fairly constrained degree, of risk. In quantitative terms, this suggests <i>risk costs </i>ranging from, say, 1/10% to 5% of exposure, depend- ing on the financial product. Overall, a bank can live with losses that cluster around, say, 1/2% to 1% of their assets. Such a “healthy appetite” is designed for longevity. Within well-run banks, risk appetite will be formally set-out so that everybody with the risk management system will know where the boundaries for unacceptable risks lie (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4584.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Board-approved Capital Management Policy  includes a <b>Risk Appetite </b>Statement that establishes enterprise-wide risk tolerances in addition to capital targets.

For example, a bond could be trading at a relatively lower price because its credit rating has been downgraded. If an investor was confident that either the rating was fundamentally inaccurate or it would bounce back up in the future, a buying investment opportunity would exist. A future downgrade would suggest selling short. In the case of credit de- rivatives, risk arbitrage was a motive for speculators to bet against market views on the fundamental risk of entities.
