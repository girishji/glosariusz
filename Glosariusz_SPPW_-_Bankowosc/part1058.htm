The excess cap- ital was exported to developed markets where savings rates dropped. Lower real interest tended to in turn encourage borrowing in the receiving econo- mies. In the case of residential mortgages financed by sub-prime debt there was a borrowing boom that fuelled a housing asset bubble. In the corporate market, excessive <i>leveraged lending </i>also occurred in a flurry of buy-out transactions. The resultant asset price correction and de-leveraging process triggered the finan- cial crisis that spilled over into the real economy with a recession in 2008–2009.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 19pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2962">Schumpeter (&amp; Banking Ideas) </a><a href="part440.htm#bookmark1369" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part440.htm#bookmark1369" class="s24">Schumpeter Joseph a idee bankowości</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4630.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">– A brilliant Austrian economist who settled in the USA in the 1930s, Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950) was particularly interested in explaining why econo- mies grow. In a pivotal study <i>Theory of Economic Development </i>(1911), he attrib- uted capitalism’s strength to a phenomenon that he labelled <i>creative destruction</i>: innovations destroyed the old but promoted the new. Without a steady stream of new technology, capitalism would tend towards a sclerotic state as bureau- cratic monopoly power or corporate routine took over. Entrepreneurs (a word which he was the chief proponent and popularizer), armed with bank credit, were the dynamic leaders who upset the stable but dull order. Schumpeter felt that innovation and change, not the market forces of supply trying to balance demand, were the fundamental impulse of capitalism. Moreover, the spirit of entrepreneurship could occur within large and medium-sized firms as well as in small ones, despite bureaucratic obstacles. Another of his legacies is the study of business strategy which Schumpeter saw as the way big business could retain its dynamism. Financiers, including banks, played a key role in Schumpeter’s vision of creative destruction. First, by their willingness to finance <i>small and medium enterprises </i>and <i>start-ups</i>, they promoted healthy challenges to the sta- tus quo. Second, by discriminating between borrowers who were “winners” or “losers”, banks were <i>gatekeepers </i>who ensured that the amount of capital sup- plied matched performance. Finally, in the cases of those in <i>default</i>, they exer- cised their <i>creditor rights </i>to eliminate the weak and hopeless. The net result of all these activities is that capital is channelled to its best uses, including highly productive assaults on comfortable routines. This lead to his view that:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4631.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bankers <span class="s12">are the gatekeepers of modern capitalist development.</span></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: right;">Joseph Schumpeter,</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy<span class="s26">, 1942</span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bankers <span class="s12">are the gatekeepers of modern capitalist development.</span></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: right;">Joseph Schumpeter,</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy<span class="s26">, 1942</span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bankers <span class="s12">are the gatekeepers of modern capitalist development.</span></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: right;">Joseph Schumpeter,</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy<span class="s26">, 1942</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="157" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4632.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1057.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1059.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
