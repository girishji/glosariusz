A hammer is pounded at the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange, similar to how a judge uses a hammer to get a court’s attention and call for silence. A “hammer price” is what an asset will fetch under the auctioneer’s block. In an arm’s length bidding situation, this may be the best break up value a seller can get when liquidating a gone concern. Fixed assets employed in a business are meant to produce output over time. When they are sold to the market, their hammer price is usually a modest portion of any going concern carrying value. In the UK, the now archaic term “hammer” can connote the failure of a firm on the London Stock Exchange.
