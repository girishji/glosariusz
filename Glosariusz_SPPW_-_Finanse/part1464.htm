A little con- fusingly, the term “company director” can refer to senior management or a mem- ber of the board of directors (<i>supervisory board </i>in continental Europe). In the case of the latter, compensation would include salaries, fees, profit sharing, stock options and various other prerequisites. Traditionally, the role of membership on a board of directors tended to be an honorary one. Since the duties of <i>oversight </i>only required a part-time devotion of energies compensation was relatively modest. However, this is changing as <i>corporate governance </i>duties become more onerous, demanding more attention, professionalism and accountability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The only way, in joint stock banking, of satisfying the last of our conditions [to attract practiced men of business] is to give to the directors – at any rate the most active and directing – say, to a committee of management, a high <span class="s30">remuneration</span>.
