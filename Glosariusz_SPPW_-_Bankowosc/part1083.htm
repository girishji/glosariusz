The social contract had largely unravelled as a powerful market and competitive and economic forces overwhelmed it. The banking sector had to compete like any industry. Alas, the <i>animal spirits </i>too often took the form of greater risk-taking to achieve unprecedented pressures for profits. Arguably, this fundamental shift in the banking business model was one of the root causes of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009. The idea of a social contract perhaps applied the most to the USA but it exists, in varying degrees, in most other countries. In just about all economies, the retail banking industry is a creature of the public interest. One of <i>post-credit crisis responses </i>will likely make the social contract more explicit and negotiated. Thus <i>utility banks </i>will be constrained in return for being protected. Investment banks and finance companies can compete, subject to regulatory frameworks, but will have the <i>right to fail </i>in return for their market freedoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4748.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The bankers’ guiding business goal was to generate a stable pool of revenue and a net interest margin sufficient to cover overheads and provide a reasonable return on capital...These bundled organisations were creatures of the [US] legal envi- ronment under which modern banks took shape.
