In some countries (e.g. banks in Canada), such a proce- dure is mandatory. While there are merits to the idea (e.g. a “fresh look”, less cosiness with management that tends to compromise auditor independence etc.), there are also disadvantages (higher <i>audit fees </i>and more <i>audit risk </i>as new auditors must learn about</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the company). As well, outsiders might see a change of auditors as a “red flag” signal that something is amiss. As demonstrated by the case of Parmalat where Italy has a “3 years maximum 3 times in a row” rotation rule, auditor rotation does not necessary eliminate <i>audit failure</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 62%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3102"><span class="s22">Auditor’s Certificate </span></a>(vernacular) <a href="part1065.htm#bookmark2624" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part1065.htm#bookmark2624" class="s25">Zaświadczenie </a><span class="s39">biegłego rewidenta </span>(żar- gon zawodowy) <span class="s23">• </span><span class="p">An informal, and no longer frequently used, reference by casual</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">financial statement users to an <i>audit opinion</i>. Certificate connotes a “stamp of approval” which assures, if not fully guarantees, accuracy. Most auditors would shudder at this characterisation. Technicians would also scoff at its sloppy thinking, pointing out that the <i>short form report </i>explicitly discourages any blind faith in an audit opinion. Various reminders (e.g. <i>management’s </i>responsibilities; audits based on <i>generally accepted audit standards, </i>only free of <i>material </i>error etc.) are imbedded in the formal opinion to alert readers to the inherent limitations of an audit. That said, while some of these warnings are sincere efforts at precision and humble honesty, much, one suspects, is a shield against lawsuits. While the <i>public accounting profession </i>has a right to defend itself against unreal- istic expectations, the notion of a “certificate” at least demonstrates what the market longs for: a simple and clear form of assurance.

One source of the auditor’s influence will be through morale suasion: their sway over management simply based on their credibility as disinterested experts. A more assertive power is a refusal to issue a <i>clean audit opinion</i>, or worse, to issue an <i>adverse opinion</i>. The ultimate sanction is their resignation from the audit and a complete disassociation with the client. As well, because the <i>capital markets </i>interpret excessive change in auditors negatively, firms cannot easily switch auditors. In the post-<i>Enron </i>envi- ronment, auditors’ powers have been re-enforced, especially in the USA where <i>Sarbanes- Oxley </i>reforms (in particular <i>Section 404 </i>requirements) have purposely buttressed their powers. Auditors are even reluctant to even give accounting advice for fear it might com- promise their <i>independence</i>. There is evidence of a backlash by some companies who complain about costly <i>audit fees </i>and excessive zeal (the national offices of <i>Big Four </i>firms, the <i>Public Company Accounting Oversight Board </i>and the <i>SEC </i>are often the target of ire). While there indeed may be a need to do some re-balancing (in 2007 the US Congress may consider tempering some of the Sarbanes-Oxley rules), <i>accounting users </i>are not unhappy. Auditors are not meant to be popular so much as respected and trusted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:85.7897pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:25pt"><td style="width:55pt" bgcolor="#000000"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: right;">m</p></td><td style="width:256pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">our File</p></td></tr><tr style="height:323pt"><td style="width:311pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt" colspan="2"><p class="s108" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Prospectus risk factors some companies may be half tempted to cite:</p><p class="s404" style="padding-left: 28pt;padding-right: 27pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="s108">“We are at the mercy of our independent auditor, which may abruptly change its views regarding proper accounting practices and blame us for it.”</span></p><p class="s404" style="padding-left: 28pt;padding-right: 27pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="s108">“We are required to restate our prior financial statements because our auditor told us we were incorrectly accounting for [insert issue here].
