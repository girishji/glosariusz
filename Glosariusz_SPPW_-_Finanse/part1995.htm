This is done for a variety of reasons. Conducive economic policy requires sound, efficient and ac- cessible financial institutions and capital markets. As a matter of consumer pro- tection, the interests of investors must be safeguarded, especially if they are un- sophisticated, small-time investors (the preverbal “maiden aunt”). Since it involves money, there is also the ever-present risk of criminal activity, such as fraud and deception. In the case of deposit-taking institutions, the money sup- ply is considered a “public good” whose soundness must be guaranteed by the state. Since the negative externals of failure are far-reaching, there is a larger public interest at work that overrides private interests (unlike industrial sectors</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">where failure is a normal and even healthy phenomenon – see <i>creative destruc- tion</i>). Finally, the pivotal role of confidence and trust in the smooth operation of the financial sector means that the sector itself benefits from the back-stop assur- ances that only a government can give. This role is especially needed in a <i>financial crisis </i>when only a government agency, in its capacity as a <i>lender of last resort</i>, can create liquidity. All of these motives offer plenty of reasons to suspend an otherwise healthy laissez-faire approach to the operation of competitive mar- kets. Traditionally it was commercial banks – carrying deposit liabilities with the public – that were the most regulated. However, with the secular trend fa- vouring a greater role for capital markets, this is changing. Increasingly, regula- tion is covering activities beyond intermediation, especially if public safety nets are deployed to stabilize markets (see <i>buyer of last resort</i>). Another trend is “in- direct regulation”. For example, when regulated banks monitor and control their exposure to hedge funds, this creates a mechanism to oversee hedge funds themselves. There is an associated cost of regulation – called the “regulatory burden”. The out-of-pocket costs increase government expenses and ultimately increase tax burdens on the tax-paying public. There is also a hidden cost of <i>morale hazard </i>from facilitating dysfunctional behaviour (instead of an align- ment in which “user pays”). Finally, whenever regulations usurp what free mar- kets could accomplish on their own, the financial sector’s efficiency suffers. Ideal regulations are “light touch” (i.e. they try to maximise the use of spontane- ous market discipline) and risk-based (focused on preventing problems vs. ad- ministrative and bureaucratic).
