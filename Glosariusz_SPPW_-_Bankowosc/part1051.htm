Rogues don’t set out to commit a fraud to directly line their own pockets. Rather, they are often compulsively gambling at the expense of their bank’s excessive exposure in the hopes of winning big and thereby benefiting in- directly (via personal glory or bonuses). Or, they may be simply trying to cover up an honest mistake. Because of the rich bonus incentives in play in the case of <i>proprietary trading</i>, rogues engaged in trading in investment banks have tended to do the most damage. A “rogue’s gallery” (see word roots below) of the most no- torious, and expensive, rogue traders in modern times would include Nick Lee-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">son of <i>Barings </i>(£650 million), John Rusnak ($691 million) of Allfirst Financial (a US subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank), Jerome Kerviel of Societe Generale (€4.5 billion) and Kweku Adoboli of UBS ($2.3 billion), the subject of the quote be- low. All of these guys did their banks severe reputational damage. One (Leeson) managed to bring down the whole bank.

Indeed, rogue traders usually can only do their nasty deeds in weak and inherently susceptible operating environments:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4605.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">His unauthorized trading also seems consistent with a cul- ture at Union Bank of Switzerland that stressed individual advancement over team efforts, according to former invest- ment bankers. ‘‘The problem isn’t the culture”, one of them told me. ‘‘The problem is that there wasn’t any culture.

Even more layers of “fail-safe” (from the lexicon of nuclear armaments) checks and balances should come from the <i>oversight </i>of an independent risk management function and the vigilance of in- ternal audit procedures. While banks have always been vulnerable to the actions culpable individuals (see quote below), a robust system of internal controls can usually be designed to thwart gregarious abuses. High-profile rogue trading losses in the press have scared the public’s confidence and respect for invest- ment banking and proprietary trading (see <i>Volcker Rule</i>). But lesser losses – and gains – probably go unreported all the time especially if the rogue was lucky/ smart enough to win (while a rogue should be punished whether they generate a loss or a gain, the tendency for the latter is to be admonished or fired but not prosecuted). Word roots: uncertain; possibly from the English Middle Ages for a “idle vagrant” from a shortened form of “roger” = thieves’ slang for a begging vagabond who pretends to be a poor scholar; roger perhaps in turn originating from the Latin “rogare” = “to ask”. The stock phrase a “rogue’s gallery” goes back to Victorian times. It is a police collection of “mug shots”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="237" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4607.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1050.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1052.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
