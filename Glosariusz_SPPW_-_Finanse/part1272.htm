While the use of debt is advantageous (see <i>leverage</i>), it must be tempered by risk of default and possible <i>insolvency</i>. In addition, since the value of a company is determined not only by the cash flow from its assets but the efficiency of asset manage- ment, debt offers certain behavioural advantages if interest costs are manage- able. <i>Entrepreneur</i>s and managers can have relatively greater equity stakes in the business when debt supplements total financing. Furthermore, the need to service debt, and commit a certain portion of cash flow to principal and inter- est payments, instils discipline and avoids slack. This is one rationale behind <i>leveraged buy-outs</i>.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3307">Carbon Finance </a><a href="part259.htm#bookmark662" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part259.htm#bookmark662" class="s23">Handel uprawnieniami do emisji CO</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: -4pt;">2</span><span class="s400"> </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">Trading in so- </span><span class="p">called “carbon credits” (formally Certified Emissions Reduction) created by the Kyoto Protocol of 2005.

Instead of cut- ting back output, most will make investments to cut back. But they are free to do this either themselves or by paying others who are in a better position to do it on their behalf. This is done by buying someone else’s permits (that’s the “trade”). By design, cap-and-trade seeks to use market mechanisms to find the most efficient way to reduce global pollution. It works especially well with low income, emerging market countries that cannot easily afford pollution abate- ment investments. Under cap-and-trade they can receive subsidies to do so from polluters in wealthy countries who need credits to meet their caps. Finan- cial institutions are getting involved by either originating new CERs and inter- mediating them to buyers (earning income on the price spread) or holding CERs as an investment in the expectation of price increases thus creating a liq- uid market. Carbon finance has been described as the “most bizarre, compli- cated, and controversial new industry of the 21<span class="s168">st </span>century” (“Fortune”, April 28, 2008, p. 58). Yet by helping to curb global warming, it may just help to save the world and burnish finance’s reputation.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3308"><span class="s21">Carried Interest </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part893.htm#bookmark2312" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Udział w zyskach </span><span class="s48">(żargon) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">The right to </span>a fixed percentage of a property’s or project’s or investment’s future <i>cash flow </i>regardless of how much other investors have to pay for its upkeep or devel- opment.

While the carried interest enjoys a fixed portion of the project’s benefits, it has none of the associated financial burden of own- ership that is “carried” or financed by others.
