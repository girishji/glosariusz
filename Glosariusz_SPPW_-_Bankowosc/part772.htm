Indeed, this is often the very reason for a holding company structure in the first place: to isolate or <i>ring fence </i>the default risk of subsidiaries.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2164"><span class="s22">Cross-default </span></a><a href="part254.htm#bookmark709" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Naruszenie warunków innej umowy wierzyciela </span>– A provi- sion in a <i>loan agreement </i>whereby a <i>default </i>in one place automatically triggers an event of default in another, usually because the fate of two loans is closely intertwined. For example, two banks may be lending to the same borrower, one with tighter terms and conditions than the other. Without a cross-default, the “tough” bank might be able to declare an event of default while the “soft” bank can only sit back and watch. Alternatively, a guaranteeing company might be “cross-defaulted” to a borrower: if something goes wrong with the guarantor, it affects the borrower’s repayment prospects so much that the borrower’s loan is threatened. Arguably cross-default clauses are a flawed way to protect against <i>term risk </i>i.e. the possibility of a deterioration of a borrower’s creditworthiness</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">over time (see quote below). In effect, a lender is saying “we are only happy if everybody else is happy” which is a weak-willed abdication of responsibility to other lenders. The other flaw in cross-default is from a borrower’s perspective. Borrowing amongst cross-defaulted lenders creates a ‘house of cards’ in which one problematic loan can bring down the whole company.
