Economic goodwill may exist because of:</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">barriers to entry for new competitors,</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">established business relationships with a favourable advantage,</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">a monopoly of unique or distinctive products or services,</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">consumer loyalty to products or brands,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s22">◆ </span>an exclusive market territory or <i>franchise</i>,</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s22">◆ </span>superior <i>management </i>skills.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">While a company may enjoy economic goodwill, you will not necessarily see it on the <i>balance sheet</i>. A combination of the principles of conservatism and his- toric cost only allow it to be recognised as accounting goodwill in <i>financial statements </i>if and when a company is acquired by an “arms length” transaction. In effect, accountants only recognise goodwill if someone is prepared to buy it. In such instances, the economic goodwill tends to disappear because earnings must “carry” (i.e. justify) the purchaser’s investment. In other words, economic goodwill is a hidden phenomenon that disappears as it is recognised. In the meantime, we only “see” goodwill in the superior earnings that existing share- holders enjoy. The difference between such earnings, capitalised at a risk-ad- justed discount rate, and net book value would be a measure of economic good- will. However, economic goodwill’s existence is only legitimised by superior earnings in relation to invested capital. It can quickly erode in a competitive market if the company makes mistakes or suffers setbacks. In the extreme case of the threat of <i>insolvency</i>, economic goodwill will evaporate entirely as the company’s value is knocked down to its break-up liquidation worth.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4206">Go Private </a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part1021.htm#bookmark2654" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part1021.htm#bookmark2654" class="s23">Wycofywanie spółek z obrotu publicznego</a></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">(żargon) <span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">To convert a publicly held business, typically with a large </span><span class="s25">float</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">which is traded on the <i>stock market</i>, to a closely held business in the hands of a few owners. Thus, the trading of shares ceases as well as the need for it to be subject to <i>securities laws </i>and regulations. Going private may occur when a ma- jority shareholder’s stake becomes so large that minority shareholders are more of an impediment than a benefit. The costs of satisfying <i>minority shareholder rights </i>and compliance with securities laws may outweigh the benefits (liquidity, access to more capital in the future, etc.) from having a traded float. Or, going private might result from a <i>management buyout</i>. Contrast to <i>going public </i>and <i>initial public offering.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="115" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_5688.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1610.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1612.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
