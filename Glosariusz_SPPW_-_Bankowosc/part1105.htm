Later, UBS had to settle costly and embarrassing infractions with US authorities, the first from misleading in- vestment advise (a $150 million fine) and the second over facilitating its client’s tax evasion activities (a $781 million fine).

The cash flows of a CDS investor – who pays a regular premium in return for receiving a large, one-time payout if the refer- ence borrower defaults – mirror the cash flow pattern of the asset itself: i.e. there are positive flows from interest payment receipt (so long as the borrower is solvent) as well as the possibility of a negative flows of lost principal if the bor- rower defaults. In the lead up to the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, synthetic CDOs allowed the subprime market to explode by overcoming a supply “bottleneck”. Instead of having to originate actual subprime loans (which might be difficult in the face of shaky housing market conditions), creators of securitised assets simply needed to find “bearish” housing market speculators willing to enter into</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">CDS contracts. By 2005, there were enough sceptics to create a market in such bets.
