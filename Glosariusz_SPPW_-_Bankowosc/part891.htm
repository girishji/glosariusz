The two conflicting policy objectives tend to be a trade-off. While a tight monetary policy could squeeze inflation out of the system it will also tend to depress growth via high interest rates impacting borrowing and in turn overall economic activity. The relative priorities will influence policy. If lambda is equal to ‘nought’ (i.e. 0) cen- tral bankers will tend to focus exclusively on fighting inflation. They will ignore concerns about growth rates or politically sensitive unemployment. In contrast, a high lambda will mean relatively more short-term tolerance for inflation lev- els that depart from a long run inflation target. Most central banks seek a bal- ance that somehow captures the best of both worlds.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2494"><span class="s22">Law, John (1671–1729) </span></a><a href="part201.htm#bookmark575" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Law, John (1671–1729) </span>– A racy but brilliant Scots financier who perpetrated, in the words of Adam Smith, “the most extravagant project both of banking and stock jobbing that perhaps the world ever saw”. Law conned the French into speculative excess in the development of their American possessions in the Mississippi River valley. Following on the heels of Law’s suc- cessful bank in Paris, his scheme involved a kind of <i>development bank</i>, named “Banque royale” in honour of the Regent’s patronage. It quickly collapsed be- cause of illiquid or non-existent assets, “fiduciary levitation” (Galbraith) and over-issuance of <i>paper money</i>. Law became a millionaire (a new word invented for the occasion) and rose to be the Comptroller General of France. Alas, when the bubble burst, it ultimately ruined hundreds of thousands of investors. Law barely escaped with his life. As a result of Law’s shenanigans, France was “per-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">manently inoculated” (Davies, p. 582) against banking.
