Yet their prominence had faded by the early 20<span class="s342">th </span>century. Similar to the vulnerabilities of a hereditary monarchy, the Rothschilds eventually succumbed to a generational dilution of talent (see “The Private Banks” in Bagehot’s <i>Lombard Street</i>). But their name still has enduringly evocative connotations of wealth and influence.

Banks are the most vulnerable to wholesale depositors in the money market who flee at the first whiff i.e. even rumour, of potential trouble. <i>Bagehot </i>argued that the psychology of <i>panic </i>could only be cured by aggressive payouts, thereby fortify- ing the need for liquidity or at least a <i>lender of last resort</i>. The fear of runs is the underlying reason for <i>regulation</i>, deposit insurance and the traditionally foggy bank accounting that tempered a bank’s bad news.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2954">Running Account </a><span class="s52">(Scottish bankers’ terminology) </span><a href="part173.htm#bookmark523" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part173.htm#bookmark523" class="s24">Konto</a><span class="s60"> bieżące </span><span class="s32">(ter- min ukuty przez szkockich bankierów) </span><span class="p">– A business’s current account that is active in the sense of it running or “operating”. Observation of deposit and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">withdrawal patterns can in turn help outsiders overcome the <i>asymmetric in- formation problem. </i>A business’s cash flow activities reveal much of about its financial health. (Note how all of the components of the cash flow statement</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">– operations, financing and investing – can flow through the deposit accounts of a bank.). If watched and interpreted intelligently, a running account can tell a lending banker a great deal about the debt service capacity of a borrower. For example, annual deposits should be about equal to accounts receivables collec- tions and, in turn, sales. If receivables are, say, 15% of sales, then a bank can gauge what is a reasonable credit usage (say, 50–65% of receivables). In many markets, banks traditionally insisted on such accounts in order for borrowers to qualify for any short-term revolving credit. Early Scottish banking principles relied on running accounts in the absence of financial statements. In contrast to English bankers, who financed trade on a transaction-by-transaction basis discounting individual <i>bills of exchange</i>, the use of the running account was a financial inno- vation that permitted continuously revolving credit. Working against a running account is the desire for split banking, either to diversify banking services or for convenience sake (a depositing bank may be situated closer to the business</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="99" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4620.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1150 <span class="s28">Running Account</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4621.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">than a lending bank). In addition, it must be admitted, tax evasion motives may resist the use of a running account. Bearing in mind that short-term credit is based on a bridging of the arrival of cash receipts in the asset conversion pro- cess, a running account is a natural fit with such forms of credit granting. To capture the benefits of a running account, a bank must organise and interpret deposit information. While reviewing individual transaction entries and bank statements can reveal a lot, the bank also needs to summarise information in a user-friendly form such as an account transaction history/profile.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="418" height="265" alt="image" src="Image_4622.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4623.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A banker must understand commercial bills - but how is he to learn?
