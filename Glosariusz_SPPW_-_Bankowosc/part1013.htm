Because of lender liability, a bank cannot take over the management function. Nonethe- less, it can still try to protect its interests by encouraging such survival tactics as:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">accelerated receivables collections</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">inventory sell-off</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">asset sales to pay-down debt</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">cost reductions to reduce slack</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">harvesting of excess capacity</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">equity infusions</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">mergers and acquisitions by a more viable concern.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">A critical attribute in workouts is a going concern that is resilient enough to withstand the banker’s pressure without collapsing. At the very least, manage- ment has to be co-operative. This usually means that problems must be detected and acted upon early enough to avoid a crisis situation. If recovery work-out fails, the bank is usually looking at either a <i>restructuring </i>or a security realisa- tion, both of which typically allow for less than 100% loan recovery. Recovery work-outs are often handled by specialists in a bank with tough dispositions, thick skins and resolute objectives (see quote below). The process can be so antagonistic that borrower and bank often part company, even when the work- out succeeds.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4410.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Harry, who was about forty five, had a big jowly round head with a thin top dressing of black and grey hair combed straight back and a chin that swelled like a melon.

Evidence suggests that banks can easily become complacent and miss obvious signs of danger (see quote be- low). At the same time, they need to know when to relax under the unpredict- ability of normal business life. This ability to discriminate between concern and sanguinity can require considerable <i>bankers’ judgement</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4414.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The money [spent on investigating the fraud] has pro- duced a lot of information about how Wall Street operated and about the extremely limited influence of those who were looking out for signs of fraud. <b>Red flags </b>were seen but discounted...
