In contrast, the word “security” is a collective noun used to describe collateral that is pledged to help protect a loan’s repayment pros- pects.

Analysts usually have a background in accounting, finance or the industry they are following. Their tools of the trade are <i>equity analysis</i>, either “fundamental” techniques (what are the underlying asset value and earnings prospects?) or “technical” techniques (what will the market do next?). Their ability to predict a share’s price must be good enough so that investors earn a profit. Analysts also have a number of other constituents. Because companies themselves are a source of information through their <i>guidance</i>, they cannot be alienated (hence a “neutral/hold” rating is interpreted as a “sell”). Finally, analysts may come under pressure from un-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">derwriters in an investment bank, where they often work, to make favourable ratings.
