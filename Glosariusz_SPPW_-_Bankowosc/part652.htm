The banknote was first developed in China in the 7<span class="s342">th </span>century. Its roots can be traced to receipts to replace the heavy bulk and physical security hazards of transacting in precious metals. Later, gold- smiths were issuers. At one time, banknotes were issued by <i>commercial banks </i>as a liability that was used by the public as part of the money supply. The Scoti- abank issued their own notes up to 1935 (see illustration). Today, a few com- mercial banks still issue their own notes (e.g. HSBC in Hong Kong) although most issuers are central banks.
