To perpetuate the <i>confidence</i>, depositors must never doubt the banks’ ability to repay. In the face of the <i>asymmetrical information problem </i>(who knows whether banks are solvent?), extra assurance is needed to ensure that deposi- tors never (or at least reluctantly) withdraw all of their funds from banks. So long as banks are well regulated, government guarantees will not be called upon. Thus, there is no burden on the public purse.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The Diamond–Dybvig Model offers some key insights into a seemingly benign nexus between the public and private sectors. That said, it ignores two important pitfalls. First, when bank liabilities become so large in comparison to the econ- omy that protecting them in a panic would force governments to issue so much money that inflation is the result (see <i>too big to save problem</i>). Thus, purchasing power cannot be guaranteed even by a government. Second, is the dilemma of <i>moral hazard </i>that results from protecting banks against their downside folly while allowing them to retain an upside to risk-taking thus encouraging im- prudent behaviour. Both problems became apparent after the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 when many governments (e.g. Ireland, Iceland and potentially even the UK and USA) struggled to prop up systematic <i>bank failures</i>. For a possible remedy, see <i>limited purpose banking</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2239"><span class="s22">Direct Debit </span></a><a href="part343.htm#bookmark1196" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Polecenie zapłaty </span>– A payment out of a bank account made with- out writing a <i>cheque/check</i>.

While <i>anti</i>-<i>money laundering </i>rules (see <i>know the customer</i>) are meant to prohibit this, evidence suggests that banks, whether knowingly or not, continue to be conduits for moving or disguising dirty money. For example, even reputable banks such as UK’s Barclays have had to pay hefty court fines for conducting transactions contrary to United States trade sanctions against so called ‘enemy’ nations (reference: article below). Typically dirty money</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">is <i>flight capital </i>leaving a country in order to evade the authorities. Often the ob- jective is to repatriate laundered money back to where it came from disguised as legitimate offshore loans. Cleansing the system of dirty money is complicated by the volume of transactions flowing across borders, the ethos of privacy in banking and the practical difficulty in verifying the provenance of every transaction pro- cessed by a large bank.
