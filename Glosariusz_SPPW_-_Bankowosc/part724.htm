It is typically a key ingredi- ent in most banks’ <i>credit culture </i>(see quote below). In order not to succumb to control fatigue, internal controls need to be well-designed (i.e. avoid overkill but pinpoint vulnerabilities) and adhered to by staff who genuinely appreciate their importance. As well, the costs of implementing controls (including <i>bu- reaucracy in banking</i>) need to be weighed against the potential gains.

Lending controls are necessary due to the dynamics of a competitive economy. A borrower’s <i>credit- worthiness </i>can deteriorate after a loan has been approved. The exercise of lend- ing controls, especially in responding to a borrower’s problems, is the natural follow-on step to monitoring. Indeed, monitoring and control are inextricably linked. One is no good without the other. In Canadian terms, they are akin to the “canoe and the paddle”. A bank has a number of weapons in its controls ar- senal, all of which tend to restrict or even reduce the availability of credit:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s23">◆ </span>if listened to, rendering <i>moral suasion </i>and advice</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">issuing less favourable credit references</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">returning cheques as </span><span class="s33">NSF</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">limiting or restricting utilisation of credit lines</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s23">◆ </span>applying receipts to <i>work down </i>loan exposure</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="80" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3169.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part723.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part725.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
