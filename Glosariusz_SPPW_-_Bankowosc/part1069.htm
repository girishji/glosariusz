Initially, security usually required possession e.g. the bank would to have bills of exchange, title deeds and gold etc. in its vault. Then the registration process allowed a security interest to attach to assets that could be retained by the borrower for its use in the business, an im- mensely more productive use of assets.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2994"><span class="s22">Security Registration </span></a><a href="part422.htm#bookmark1335" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Rejestracja zabezpieczenia </span>– A record at a public registry substantiating that specified lenders claim a <i>security interest </i>in a speci- fied asset. It sorts out, on a “first registered; first priority” basis, competing pri- orities whenever there are common claims on the same asset. Registration is an important element in security’s <i>perfection. </i>Security’s enforceability is enhanced by registration in two ways. As a vetting device, the registry office will check, but cannot guarantee, that the charge documents do not contain an obvious flaw. Secondly, assuming they bother to “search” the registry, competing creditors</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">will be forewarned to avoid <i>double pledges</i>. Security registration is used for real estate (mortgages and fixed charge debentures), equipment (chattel mortgages), inventory, receivables (book debts assignments) and umbrella corporate assets (floating charge debentures).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2995"><span class="s22">Self-liquidating Loan </span></a><a href="part439.htm#bookmark1367" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Samolikwidacja </span>– A transaction which, upon its com- pletion, repays any associated debt by a cash flow generation. For example, dis- counting a bill of exchange is self-liquidating: when the bill is collected at its maturity, the cash is applied against the loan that financed it to permanently extinguish or retire the associated financing. Another example would be a sea- sonal bulge loan to finance peak inventories. After the borrower’s “high-season”, the bulge should <i>clean up </i>i.e. be completed eliminated and not needed until the next season. Finally, in <i>agricultural lending</i>, a crop loan for seeds and fertilizer</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">etc. should be liquidated soon after the harvest. Self-liquidating loans are a very pure form of short-term credit. A lender is providing a kind of bridge through time. Whatever is being financed will also repay the loan. The focus is on the successful completion of a single transaction which by virtue of the bank fi- nancing should assure its own repayment, largely independent of the borrower’s financial status. If the loan doesn’t repay as planned, the lender must resort to a <i>second way out</i>. In contrast, loans that are not self-liquidating look to other repayment sources such as re-financing by another lender or future debt service capacity (see <i>term loan</i>). Although they seem similar a self-liquidating loan is not quite the same as an <i>asset conversion </i>loan such as a working capital facility. While such loans are paid down by self-liquidation (for example, the collection of an account receivable), they are immediately redrawn again to finance a new</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="140" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4697.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1068.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1070.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
