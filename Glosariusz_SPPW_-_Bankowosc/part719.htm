In fractional reserve banking, most deposits are redeployed into <i>earning assets </i>such as loans or the money market. A relatively modest amount – say 5% – is held back to satisfy withdrawals. Banks play the game by hoping that depositors have sufficient confidence in the bank that they “won’t ask” in the first place. If – heaven forbid</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">– they “do ask”, it is hoped that it is not an all-at-once <i>run </i>on the bank. In the meantime, by graciously paying out <i>on demand </i>without hesitation, banks can ‘prove’ their creditworthiness and avoid a <i>panic</i>. A frightened depositor might turn around and redeposit the withdrawal once the bank has been put to the test. The key, as <i>Bagehot </i>noted (see quote below) is that the bank cannot shy away from honouring its liabilities even if by doing so it gets closer to the default it so fears. In banking, ‘Talk is cheap and actions speak louder than words’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3138.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Every banker knows that if he has to <i>prove </i>that he is worthy of credit, however good may be his arguments, in fact his credit is gone… Credit is a power which may grow, but can- not be constructed.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walter Bagehot, “The Private Banks” in <i>Lombard Street</i>, 1873</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Every banker knows that if he has to <i>prove </i>that he is worthy of credit, however good may be his arguments, in fact his credit is gone… Credit is a power which may grow, but can- not be constructed.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walter Bagehot, “The Private Banks” in <i>Lombard Street</i>, 1873</p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Every banker knows that if he has to <i>prove </i>that he is worthy of credit, however good may be his arguments, in fact his credit is gone… Credit is a power which may grow, but can- not be constructed.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walter Bagehot, “The Private Banks” in <i>Lombard Street</i>, 1873</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3139.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2014"><span class="s22">Confidentiality (Banker’s) </span></a><a href="part475.htm#bookmark1435" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Tajemnica bankowa </span>• The right and obligation of a <i>bank </i>to keep its clients affairs in private vis-à-vis third parties, including government authorities. Since a basic service of banks is to provide financial security, privacy (to avoid nosy prying or even extortion of wealth holdings) is an integral part of a bank’s business model. Indeed, it is not just an ethical imperative but is also in a bank’s best commercial interests in order to safeguard its reputation (see quote below). However, maintaining full confidentially is coming under pressure from government authorities fighting criminal activities (see <i>money laundering</i>) and electronic banking where information is increasing open and accessible. In general, all client information must be kept in confi- dence with the exception of the following:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">compulsion of statute law (e.g. income tax law) or court order</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">public duty where criminal activity, such as money laundering, is suspected</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">to protect the bank’s own interest in recovering debts e.g. suing for recovery</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of an unsecured loan</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">when provided with the consent of customer e.g. the permission to respond</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">to credit enquiries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="185" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3140.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">820 <span class="s28">Conflicts of Interest (in Banking)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Although people traditionally speak of “banking secrecy”, it is important to note that this duty of discretion is not intended to protect the bank but rather the client.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3141.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By living up to the principles set out in these Guidelines, doing business with integrity and working together to sus- tain our core values, we can entrust future generations of Scotiabankers with the gift of the enviable reputation we have inherited (p. 3)… Principle 4, “Respect <b>Confidential- ity</b>”: You have an obligation to safeguard the personal and business information entrusted to us by customers and em- ployees, as well as the confidentiality of Scotiabank’s own affairs.

Simply having two masters is best described as a “conflict of loyalty”. As the Bible reminds us – “Parable of the Talents” (Mat- thew 25:14-30; Luke 19:12-28) – since we can only be fully loyal to one master, it is difficult (but possible) to trust a shared servant’s sincerity or reliability.

A buyer and seller have a conflict of interest over price. But both can still deal with one another based on the caveat emptor (‘let the buyer beware’) principle. In banking, the potential for conflicts of interest has tended to be the greatest in <i>investment bank</i>ing. Impartial securities research can con- flict with under-writing (see quote below). Or, trading and underwriting can conflict when a bank sells short what it has just brought to the market<i>. </i>Combin- ing commercial banking activities with investment banking needs conscious</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="247" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3143.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part718.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part720.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
