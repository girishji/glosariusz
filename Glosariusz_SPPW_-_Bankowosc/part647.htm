There can be contradicting motives – favouring either frank or discrete disclosure – at work in a banker’s reference. Banks, which are known to have access to extensive financial information (e.g. <i>deposit </i>accounts, credit facilities and financial statements), are generally expected to possess more insight than a trade reference. At the same time, customers want to convey favourable fi- nancial reputations. When the bank’s own loan is at risk, it may be tempted to put on an optimistic front in order to encourage trade credit and preserve the going concern. Balancing this are <i>confidentiality </i>issues and an obligation to the enquirer to be objective. A bank reference should therefore be discreet, factual</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">and avoid opinions, letting readers reach their own conclusions. Some examples might include the following wording, although references are often shorter and more “coded” (see quote below):</p><p class="s349" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 127pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Positive<span class="s350">: “Our client ABC Company has had satisfactory deal- ings with this branch for the past 3 years, carrying healthy credit balances fluctuating in the mid 6 figures and enjoying a credit facility in the low 7 figures. To our knowledge, ABC is generally well regarded in the trade and is able to meet its normal obligations on time, including the amount of your en- quiry for $100,000. This reference is given without recourse to liability.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s349" style="padding-left: 127pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Cautionary<span class="s350">: “Our client ABC Company has been dealing with this branch for the past 3 years, carrying credit balances which fluctuate up to the low 5 figures and, depending upon availa- bility, has access to credit in the high 6 figures. While they have generally been able to meet their normal obligations, periodic working capital constraints can limit prompt payments for the amount of your $100,000 enquiry.
