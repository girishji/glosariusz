The “exchange” component came from its use as consideration for receiving goods that evidenced indebtedness and gave terms for future cash payment. When the privilege to pay later was incorporated, bills of exchange were common financing tools in early (19<span class="s342">th </span>cen- tury) business. Since the bills represented future cash, usually 30 to 90 days in the future, they could be given as payment if the recipient was willing to accept the <i>credit risk </i>of the “maker”. As commercial law and practice developed in Britain, bills became <i>negotiable instruments </i>and, when circulated along a pay-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">ment chain, part of the money supply. Early bankers, adhering to the <i>real bills doctrine</i>, lent money by either purchasing the bills at a discount or by their acceptance that guaranteed payment. As commercial practice developed, sell- ing on open account (following provision of goods or services, an invoice is issued) replaced the practice of drawing bills. Banks financed working capital by providing <i>revolving </i>or operating lines of credit. See also <i>bill of exchange, ac- counting for (</i>see the <i>Compendium of Accounting</i>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2897.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mercantile <b>bills </b>are an exceedingly difficult kind of security to understand.
