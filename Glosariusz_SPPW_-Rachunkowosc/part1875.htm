It acknowledges that financial reporting has inherent imprecision and allows the exer- cise of <span class="s27">commercial common sense </span>to create practical information. However, its pliancy can also lead to abuses. For example, a number of separate “immaterial” errors can be collectively significant. If they were made by design, the integrity of the whole account- ing process can be questioned (“God is in the small things”). As well, in <span class="s27">stock markets, </span>missing an <span class="s27">EPS </span>estimate by a penny can lead to large market <span class="s27">capitalisation </span>losses. This causes materiality thresholds to be lower. In summary, materiality is not a “bright line cut-off” concept so much as judgement call on the investor’s interests.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4621">Measurement Uncertainty, Disclosure </a><a href="part460.htm#bookmark1118" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part460.htm#bookmark1118" class="s25">Niepewność wyceny, ujawnianie</a></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s23">• </span>A requirement under most <i>accounting standards </i>to <i>disclose </i>all major sources of uncer-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">tainty in <i>accounting estimates </i>and <i>accounting judgements </i>in the <i>notes </i>to the financial</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">statements. Disclosure should include not only the existence of the uncertainty but its nature and how the uncertainty was handled (e.g. assumptions made and the logic for them). Such disclosure serves two purposes. First, it warns readers about the inherent imprecision of financial results. Second, it allows them to make their own adjustments should they wish (and be able) to make different assumptions for the sake of their own financial analysis.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4622"><span class="s22">Memorandum Account </span></a><a href="part285.htm#bookmark692" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Konto memoriałowe </span><span class="s23">• </span>An account, which is not a part of the <i>assets </i>or <i>liabilities </i>of a <i>balance sheet</i>, which is used to record and control assets, obliga- tions or future commitments, typically <i>off</i>-<i>balance sheet items</i>.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4623">Mergers Accounting </a><a href="part685.htm#bookmark1685" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part685.htm#bookmark1685" class="s25">Rachunkowość fuzji (połączenia przedsiębiorstw)</a><span class="s39"> </span><span class="s23">•</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">The accounting used to portray two or more companies which consummate a <i>merger </i>by</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">voluntarily coming together to join forces. This is in contrast to the accounting employed when one company buys another. The latter, which is called <i>acquisition accounting, </i>sim- ply assumes that the purchase of a company is no different than the purchase of any other asset i.e. at cost at the <i>fair value </i>of purchase consideration. Merger accounting cannot ref- erence any purchase price because there has been no buy-sell transaction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Financial statements are presented as if the combining enterprises had always been one. Carrying values are only adjusted to harmonize accounting policies; there are no adjustments to market value or recognition of goodwill. Inter-company transactions are eliminated. Because mergers are, relative to <span class="s27">acquisitions</span>, rare, merger accounting is employed less often. Merger accounting is a British term.
