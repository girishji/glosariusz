Thus, for banks entering emerging and transition markets, the unbanked can repre- sent attractive volume growth opportunities since more accounts tend to be opened as economies grow (see graph above; in the case of Poland, a survey</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">– Pentor Research for Bank Pocztowy – in 2011 put the unbanked at a figure lower than 34%). In other less developed countries, <i>microfinance </i>is often a bet- ter vehicle to reach the unbanked. Under the name of “financial inclusion”, get- ting the unbanked into the financial system is also a public policy goal for gov- ernments and <i>development banks </i>in many poorer countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3162"><span class="s22">Unclaimed Financial Assets </span></a><a href="part262.htm#bookmark730" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Nieodebrane aktywa finansowe </span><b>– </b>Financial assets that people have forgotten or neglected. Dormant accounts are the most common example in banking. Many people will forget about small amounts or suddenly die without their heirs knowing about the existence of the mon- ies. Dividends are another commonly unclaimed asset. In the UK, for example, the Banking Automated Clearing Service revealed that each year thousands of share dividend <i>cheques </i>never get cashed (perhaps because recipients are often elderly). Under UK corporate laws, such unclaimed dividends are returned to</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">issuers after 12 years. In the case of banks, dormant accounts often have to be publicly proclaimed and then, if they remain unclaimed, eventually turned over to some designated public body. The cumulative amounts can be surprisingly large, considering how most people value money. For example, the Unclaimed Assets Register, a company that helps people trace lost financial assets, estimate that the total amount of such assets is over £15 billion in the UK alone (<b>“</b>The Times”, 5/05/01). That said, most individual amounts are typically rather mod- est. Sorting out unclaimed financial assets imposes an ethical and administra- tive burden on banks. For example, the issue of “Holocaust Cash” arose in the case of <i>Swiss banks </i>who were accused of being lethargic in tracing the relatives of deceased owners of dormant accounts from WWII.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3163">Uncollectible </a><span class="s52">(vernacular) </span><a href="part268.htm#bookmark747" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Nieściągalne </span><span class="s32">(potoczne) </span><span class="p">– The point at which consumer loans in default cannot be recovered either because of the borrower cannot be found, their acute financial distress (“blood out of stone”) or a dearth of collateral security (“the cupboard is empty”).
