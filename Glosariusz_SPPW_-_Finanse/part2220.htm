However, because the rest of the market does not seem to appreciate such value, the shares are underpriced and offer a buying oppor- tunity. For example, a sleepy and unglamorous business might be quietly plug- ging away to exploit opportunities in its marketplace. It will be generating good returns and steady growth. Yet it may have a low <i>price-earnings ratio </i>because the stock market is not very excited about the company’s story<i>. </i>Or, investors may not be doing enough homework to appreciate the opportunity staring at them from the financial figures. Shares in such a company are considered a “value stock”. Value investing is in contrast to speculation and “growth investing” that focuses on business with high earnings growth and high P/E multiples. The idea</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">was attributed to <i>Benjamin Graham </i>and is successfully employed by such lumi- naries as <i>Warren Buffett</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5797"><span class="s21">Venture Capital </span></a><a href="part330.htm#bookmark844" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Kapitał wysokiego ryzyka </span><span class="s22">• </span>High risk <i>capital</i>, typically sup- plied in the form of shareholder’s equity, which is used to finance start-ups, leveraged acquisitions, high-tech breakthroughs and other tricky investment propositions. It may be supplied from funds or through individual business an- gels. In the face of such a <i>risk appetite</i>, target returns must be generous (say, 30–50% per year) and are usually captured after a medium term exit of 5–7 years. “Vencaps” cash out as their winners go to the next stage of their growth (e.g. buyout or going public). The other, less serendipitous investments are either written off or sold at a loss. Often venture capitalists will take a proactive ap- proach over <i>management </i>in order to protect their interests and provide hands- on coaching. The venture capital game tends to be “hit and miss” on any par-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">ticular bet. Rather it is designed to average out over a portfolio’s track record. A typical mix might include “duds” (lemons which flop), “superstars” (exception- al, jackpot returns sometimes called “plums”) and “the living dead” (viable but performing below expectations). Such disparate outcomes make venture capital an exciting and glamorous business that requires creativity, commercial savvy, sound judgement and an ability to tolerate high levels of risk. That said, it is not about taking punts on whacky ideas. Rather, since the essence of entrepreneur- ship is “making things happen”, venture capitalists are highly selective about backing their choices (see p. 134). A robust source of venture capital is very important to an economy’s dynamism. Its strong presence in the United States is one of the reasons why that economy has been so successful in providing <i>ac- cess to capital</i>.
