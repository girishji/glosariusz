However, extenuating circumstances or a well-developed rationale might persuade a bank to “go along” with the proposal (a stock phrase which suggests reluctant willingness). An example might be why a customer who “screwed” the bank previously deserves a second chance (there might be le- gitimate reasons to forgive them; then again, “once bitten, twice shy” may be more sensible). It could also be a loan proposition that doesn’t qualify as a straight-forward policy loan but which a </span>sponsor <span class="p">genuinely believes deserves an over-ride. The credit memorandum for such deals has to be particularly well- crafted to explain the story to readers. Story credits have their place. Not all loans fit into a neat, predictable pattern. That said, the unconventional is often riskier, if only because the true situation is more difficult to grasp.</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3071">Street Value </a><span class="s52">(vernacular) </span><a href="part91.htm#bookmark374" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Chodzić po ileś </span><span class="s32">(potoczne) </span><span class="s64">– </span><span class="p">The value of some- thing sold in the informal, fragmented marketplace of individual final consum- ers i.e. literally on the street.

Such ‘what if ’ queries could also be described as “downside scenario” testing. They consider the hypotheti- cal unexpected losses (expected losses would be reflected by yield premiums designed to compensate for risk). In the case of a diversified portfolio of invest- ments, stress tests would have to take account of the potentially complex inter- relationships between individual entities (see also <i>value at risk</i>). Stress testing is a powerful risk management tool that can quantify the amount of capital needed to absorb losses in the worst possible times. During and after the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, banking regulators used the stress test technique to quantify poten-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tial bank losses under severe economic conditions, such as increased unemploy- ment, depressed securities markets and continued home-price declines.

When stress testing is transparent, credible and made public, it is also a confidence-building mechanism for jittery financial markets who cannot eas- ily gauge the soundness of institutions (having lost their blind faith in credit ratings).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="81" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4804.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1096.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1098.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
