Transfer pricing is often necessary for <i>profit centers </i>in order to create an “internal market”. For example, a <i>multi-national corporation </i>may have production facilities in different locations that supply each other at group transfer prices. Or, a bank’s <i>branch network </i>may use transfer pricing for funds bought and sold</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">between a branch outlet and a central, head-office treasury department. For reasons of economic allocative efficiency (i.e. to avoid subsidies and/or wastage), transfer pricing should be at or close to <i>arm’s length </i>market prices (in this regard, <i>standard costs </i>can be a form of transfer pricing). However, it may be difficult to find outside benchmarks for goods or services unique to a particular group or company. Because it is arbitrary, transfer pricing can also be used to create “managed” profits, which is illegal in many countries. In the case of global enterprises, transfer pricing is often motivated by politi- cal, exchange control and income tax considerations. To the degree allowed by tax authorities, profits can be thereby allocated between related parties in the most <i>tax-effi- cient </i>way. Output from a high-tax country is transferred at low prices to reduce taxable income. In turn, the buying unit in a low-tax country generates a higher profit but is taxed relatively less. Collectively, the company can reduce its overall tax bill. Offsetting this <i>tax avoidance </i><a href="http://www.oecd.org/" class="s24" target="_blank">exercise is the requirement by most tax authorities that transfer prices at least approximate market arm’s-length prices. But when there is no genuinely independent market with which to compare transfer prices, there is a degree of maneu- verability in setting prices. In today’s globalised economy (over half the world’s trade is conducted within multi-nationals; reference the “Financial Times” article below), the stakes for both tax collectors and taxpayers are large. To create a level playing field the OECD has established a set of “Transfer Pricing Guidelines” which, if closely followed in setting transfer prices between related parties, should reduce the risk of a success- ful challenge from tax authorities in OECD countries.
