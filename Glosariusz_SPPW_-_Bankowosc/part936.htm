Because of economies of scale and their regulated, utility-like operations, it is not uncommon for banks to be big com- pared to industrial concerns. For example, Scotiabank’s 2008 balance sheet was a half-trillion Canadian dollars. That’s “big” considering that Canada’s largest industrial concern (an oil company) has $31 billion in assets (ref: “Forbes”), although because of their high leverage banks invariably have lots of assets. Megabanks are ‘humongous’ with, say, more than a trillion dollars in assets. The largest in the world in 2009 were over two trillion dollars (see graph below). All megabanks are likely classified as <i>systematically important financial institutions </i>and as such will be compelled in the future to operate under tougher regula-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4094.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tions, including a <i>capital surcharge. </i>Megabanks present two challenges. The first is in managing them prudently and efficiently. The Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, got into trouble with a merger and is now a ward of the UK Treas- ury. Others, such as HSBC and JP Morgan Chase have a sterling performance record. The other concern is their potential harm to the rest of the financial system in the event of them going bust (see quote below). While ‘size counts’, it can count too much.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4095.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This increased the involvement of big banks in dangerous financial activities, which led to growth in systemic risks.
