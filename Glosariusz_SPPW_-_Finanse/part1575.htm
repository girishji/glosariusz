When the foreign currency is repurchased or resold (i.e. the foreign cur- rency position is eliminated), the holding gain or loss will be realised (i.e. con- verted into cash). Thus all foreign currency transactions are, by definition, “realised”. (Arguably there is an unrealised component in the brief period be- tween contracting for delivery and settlement.) It is important to distinguish between a foreign currency transaction, where an actual exchange occurs and a foreign currency translation. The former is an economic event; the latter is an accounting measurement of what an item is worth in another currency.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4114">Forgery </a><a href="part182.htm#bookmark463" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Falsyfikat </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">A bank note, share certificate or financial document that is fake (i.e. not the real thing) but which is designed to fool unsuspecting parties by its close imitation. In the case of bank notes, forgery is called “counterfeit- ing”. Forgery was traditionally a concern in finance since financial transactions were conducted by exchanging pieces of paper representing the financial con- tract. If the document could be duplicated, a fraud could be perpetrated by ex- changing the forged document for cash. With the rise of modern printing tech- niques and electronic transactions, forgery is a less common crime (although the crime of computer fraud has taken its place).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4115"><span class="s21">Forward Contract </span></a><a href="part361.htm#bookmark927" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Kontrakt terminowy typu forward </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">A contractual agree- </span>ment to buy or sell something in the future at a predetermined “delivery” price. The agreement to buy is referred to as a <i>long </i>position; to sell is <i>short</i>. By “locking in” fixed price, a forward contract reduces uncertainty from possible price fluctua- tions and hence acts as a <i>hedging </i>tool. Forward contracts exist for both commodi- ties and <i>financial instruments</i>. For example, a buyer of goods denominated in a foreign currency may wish to be sure of the price and availability of the foreign currency. If foreign exchange markets are sufficiently developed, a buyer can enter a forward purchase contract by finding a counterparty willing to sell forward. (Of course, the buyer could always buy the currency in the <i>spot market </i>and invest it</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="84" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_5605.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1574.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1576.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
