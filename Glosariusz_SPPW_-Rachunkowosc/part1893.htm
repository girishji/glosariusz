Compared to “normal” goodwill, negative goodwill is comparatively rare. There are several reasons for this. The prudence convention tends</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to keep book values below market values. In inflationary periods, market values usually creep ahead of historical costs. There is also a need to induce shareholders to sell by offer- ing an attractive purchase price. All these factors result in acquisition prices of going con- cerns that are typically above both book value and fair market values of individual assets. When it does occur, negative goodwill can create some interesting accounting issues. Perhaps the acquirer obtained the company at a bargain price and any surplus fair value should be immediately recognized as income? Since the assets are worth more apart than together, this implies an <i>asset stripping </i>would be in order; perhaps income should be recognised as the assets are sold at their <i>fair value</i>? Assuming that the buyer and seller reached a rational <i>arm’s length </i>agreement (i.e. there was no real bargain), perhaps the excess fair value is illusionary? i.e. fair values are incorrect and/or there are contingent liabilities? This suggests an immediate write down of fair values to eliminate negative goodwill. We offer an example:</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1892.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1894.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
