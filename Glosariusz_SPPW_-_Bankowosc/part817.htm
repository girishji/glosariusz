This would seem straightforward enough since the whole point of collateral security is in support of loan exposure. Once repaid, the need clearly falls away. But the ‘devil is in the details’. Has the debt been fully extinguished? Your author once heard of a bank that refused to release a mortgage until the customer could prove that the bank’s own loan had been repaid! Other con- sumer abuses involve the payment of various fees. Another issue is timing. The bank will release the security but might do so in its own time, in the meantime hoping that foot-dragging might encourage the borrower to leave things as they are (‘in case of a future need to borrow’). This may arise if the borrower wants to switch banks (since existing security needs to be reassigned to the new lender).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Finally, equity of redemption demonstrates that a bank loan based solely on col- lateral security is more akin to <i>pawn brokering </i>or a <i>repo </i>than a true extension of credit (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3574.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is mistake to suppose that security for a loan is all that matters; that a banker, so long as he is well covered, droops into a benign attitude of carefree complacency.

The CSR ethos is part of a larger social movement towards more accountability in the business sector.
