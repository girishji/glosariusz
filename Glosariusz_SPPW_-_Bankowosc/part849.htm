Bold central bank action was needed to thaw the markets. In mid-2007, the <i>lenders of last resort </i>in the USA, EU and Britain collectively injected hundreds of billions of their respective currency units into interbank markets. They did this by lend- ing directly to banks which substituted access to the <i>re-discount window </i>to bank counterparties. In some respects, history is repeating itself (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3741.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Final details of the bank aid corporation, through which the administration hopes to release billions of dollars in deposits tied up in closed banks, as one means of avoiding inflation, were reported to have been settled today [Oct. 10<span class="s382">th</span>, 1933] at a White House conference.

Often loan product portfolios can be ‘self-financing’ in the sense that deposits will tend to automati- cally accompany them. For instance, growth in retail deposits (say by opening new branches) will usually generate a flow of consumer loans from <i>cross-selling </i>activities. A bank expanding in this fashion will therefore not be subject to li- quidity pressures or funding gaps. In contrast, a loan to a large corporate cus-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="203" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3743.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">950 <span class="s28">Funding-light vs. Funding Intensive</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tomer will seldom be accompanied by deposit balances. Such loans will either have to be funded by surplus core deposits or by tapping the wholesale money market. If the funding is in a foreign hard currency, say US dollars, an added complication arises from the possibility of <i>frozen credit markets </i>(see quote be- low). Thus banks tend to shy away from “intensive” wholesale funding sources during times of uncertainty. Their safe haven is “funding-light” activities such as retail banking.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="417" height="431" alt="image" src="Image_3744.png"/></span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When there is loss of confidence, the global tendency is (generally speaking) to sell all classes of assets and go into cash, with US$, still considered as the safest. In the past month or so, as a result of the “scare” in Europe, foreigners (as well as wealthy locals) have been selling their local cur- rency denominated assets and buying US$. What’s the im- pact on us? Our bank does a modest amount of US$ len- ding (maybe 10% of its total portfolio). It funds that portfolio on the wholesale market. US$ are available, of co- urse, but at a high cost which renders our US$ portfolio unprofitable. Hence the need to stop lending US$ and call in all US$ loans ASAP. In the case of world-wide banking, as the US$ is so widely used, and as most banks (outside the USA) fund those US$ on the wholesale market, US$ are suddenly hard to find as well. So even the otherwise huge US$ interbank market can dry up. All this shows you how fragile the market is currently and how quickly it can all go to pot once confidence starts to be lost.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">E-mail to your author explaining why “the far-away Euro area crisis impacts us in Asia”, from a friend and colleague who is on the board</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 197pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">of directors of an Asian bank, October 2011</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part848.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part850.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
