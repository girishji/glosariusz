It would also be called a “security shortfall” by other bankers. An air-ball represents real risk to the lender. Not only is there an unsecured loan (bad but perhaps tolerable) but there is also a deficient repayment source. One solution for an air-ball is to provide a <i>term loan</i>, perhaps secured by fixed assets, which is used to pay down the line of credit to eliminate the air-ball.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="412" height="0" alt="image" src="Image_2599.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Air-ball</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="286" height="148" alt="image" src="Image_2600.png"/></span></p><p class="s113" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -4pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Short term credit line has been used to finance long term assets or a deficit</p><p class="s113" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -4pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Short term credit line has been used to finance long term assets or a deficit</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s113" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -4pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Short term credit line has been used to finance long term assets or a deficit</p><p class="s113" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amount</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s113" style="padding-left: 149pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: left;">Financed assets Utilised line of credit</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Air-ball</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s113" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Time</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2601.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1678"><span class="s22">Allowance for Credit Losses </span></a><a href="part423.htm#bookmark1338" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Rezerwa na straty z tytułu kredytów </span>– A contra-account (for details see the <i>Compendium of Accounting</i>) on a lender’s balance sheet that is designed to absorb expected losses in a portfolio of loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="156" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2602.png"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 281pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Allowance for Credit Losses <span class="s27">693</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">This is to be consistent with the accounting convention that held-to-maturity financial asset values should be carried at the ‘lower of cost or net realisable value’. The allowance is updated each financial reporting period to reflect the latest expected recovery rates on the loan portfolio. Recovery rates are in turn a function of the loan portfolio’s performance (re: defaults and risk classifications) as well as external factors such as the state of the economy in a business cycle. Net increases in the allowance represent an expense in the period; allowance decreases are a negative expense (or ‘expense recovery’). The allowance will have two components: a “specific” for known doubts on individually identifiable loans and a “general” to capture portfolio-wide sources of losses in the background (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2603.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The [balance sheet figure] <b>allowance for credit losses </b>rep- resents management’s best estimate of the probable credit losses in the portfolio of deposits with other institutions, loans to borrowers, acceptances and other indirect credit commitments, such as letters of credit and guarantees.

A bank’s allowance for credit losses is a ‘mission critical’ financial reporting number since it directly impacts profitability and, in turn, <i>bank capital</i>. A measurement challenge arises because much (but not all) of the allowance must bebasedonthe exercise of discretionary management estimates. Theproblem is the most acute in portfolios thathavenot <i>seasoned </i>i.e. where actual loan loss experience provides a fairly reliable predictor of expected losses based on default rates and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="197" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2605.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part598.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part600.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
