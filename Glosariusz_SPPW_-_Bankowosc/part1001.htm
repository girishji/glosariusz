Proprietary trading – especially their secretive as- pects – has taken on a certain sinister meaning in the banker’s lexicon. After the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 many commercial banks were poisoned by so-called toxic assets that in theory were supposed to be safe, or at least quantifiable, bets. Regulators, shareholders, rating agencies and creditors are all now shunning departures from traditional intermediation that proprietary trading represents.

For a banker, this means being careful, thorough, realistic, some- times sceptical, always rational and just plain smart for the business they’re in. A sense of prudential care is prerequisite to banking (see quote below). The spirit of active prudence is content with being conservative without worrying about personal inadequacy from lack of “imagination”, “guts” or “intelligence”, the common accusations of discontented customers. Being prudent is actually a form of calm confidence in knowing what you can reasonably do and what you cannot reasonably do as a rational economic player. Relying on a projected cash flow from a borrower who has never remotely achieved forecasted perfor- mance levels in the past is an example of imprudence.
