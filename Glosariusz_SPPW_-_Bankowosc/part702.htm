Coming from the word meaning “on the side”, “accompanying” or “auxiliary”, collateral is an external means to supplement the <i>creditworthiness </i>of a borrower. Collateral has a different meaning depending on the context and place:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s23">◆ </span>Assets which are pledged as security or subject to a <i>security interest. </i>This is the most common usage of the word that treats it as synonymous with “security”.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">Supplementary or additional security to reinforce the main security.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">For example, a “collateral <i>mortgage</i>” is a term used to describe the real estate</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">pledged in support of a <i>promissory note</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s23">◆ </span>In the UK, “collateral” is taken to mean security, such as a <i>guarantee</i>,</p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">provided by a third party to the borrower.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">While used interchangeably by many bankers, there is subtle distinction be- tween “collateral” and “security”. Based on its etymology, collateral infers some- thing of secondary importance. The lender’s primary confidence lies in the <i>re- payment </i>capacity of a going concern. Collateral is used as a way to create a bankers’ <i>second way out</i>, a desperate but sometimes necessary way to recover advances as a contingency plan for an insolvent borrower. Making loans on such a basis compels banks to <i>know the borrower </i>as well as to be confident about the borrower’s competitive viability (see <i>credit analysis</i>). This performance-focused credit allocation helps banks fulfil their <i>gatekeeper function</i>. In contrast, based on its etymology, “security” implies a source of safety or freedom from doubt quite apart from the borrower’s <i>creditworthiness</i>. Security is comfort even in the pessi- mistic expectation of a gone concern assumed to be ready for a ‘liquidation anal- ysis’. This pledge-focused credit allocation tends to favour asset accumulation and can often lead to asset price bubbles. Depending on the situation, one attitude is more appropriate than another.
