After becoming a <i>CPA </i>at age 23 (the youngest in Illinois), he set up his own accounting and auditing practice. Andersen used his mother’s Nordic motto as a credo for his business dealings: “Think straight, talk straight.” The young firm prospered but almost faltered in 1947 when its founder died at an early age. In the 1950s &amp; `60s, the firm was lead by <i>Leonard Spacek</i>, a recognised industry leader (see <i>Accounting Hall of Fame</i>). In 1954, it installed one of the world’s first commercial computers at a plant at General Electric, fore- shadowing its leadership in IT <i>management consulting</i>. Besides riding the IT wave well ahead of others, the Andersen firm had other distinctions to separate it from the pack. It was run as a hierarchical chain of worldwide command rather than a cluster of autonomous partnerships. While this sacrificed flexibility in local markets, it permitted a more systematic and uniform delivery of services. It had its own corporate university for training. Its people were stepped in a strong corporate culture that seemed to emphasise conformity over individuality (crit- ics called Andersen staff “Androdes”). But the formula was highly successful. By 1979 Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. had grown to become the world’s biggest professional services concern. In 2000, disputes over the relationship between its <i>audit </i>and <i>consulting </i>practices lead to a split (the consulting arm operating separately as a firm named Accenture). Yet the auditing firm continued to be involved in consulting. Its vulnerabilities to <i>conflict of interest </i>problems were exposed in 2001 when it was embroiled in the <i>Enron </i>scandal. Another high profile scandal at Worldcom would soon follow. The “last nail in its coffin” was an admission to a criminal charge of shredding documents while Enron was being criminally investigated. In the end, Andersen succumbed to a combination of mega-lawsuits, an irreparable loss of reputation and regulatory censure. This ultimately led to the break-up of the firm and its piecemeal absorp- tion into its competitors. Ironically, a subsequent court judgement in 2005 partially exoner- ated the firm from its worst accusations. But it was too late. Arthur Andersen’s demise is a potent example of the hazards of <i>reputation risk</i>. Least the <i>Final Four </i>become smug; they may (secretly) harbour the wisdom that “There, but for the grace of God, go we.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:84.0186pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:25pt"><td style="width:55pt" bgcolor="#000000"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: right;">s</p></td><td style="width:256pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td></tr><tr style="height:85pt"><td style="width:311pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt" colspan="2"><p class="s108" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 28pt;padding-right: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I’m here today because faith in our firm and the integrity of the capital markets has been shaken… I believe that there is a crisis of confidence in my profession. <span class="s109">Real change </span>will be required to gain public trust.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 30pt;padding-right: 22pt;text-indent: 43pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Joseph Berardino, CEO of Andersen Congressional testimony on Enron bankruptcy quoted in “Fortune Magazine”, January 7, 2002, p. 54</p></td></tr></table><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1221.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1223.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
