The world-wide trend of increasing competitive pres- sure (both from other banks and outsiders whose access to new technology can often penetrate traditional bank markets) is slowly but surely squeezing bank profit margins. In response, banks realise that will only earn attractive share- holder returns by building a competitive and distinctive strategy. In doing so, they now often employ retailing concepts such as “distribution channels”, “value added supply chain” and central value proposition as they strive to attract and retain good customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2599"><span class="s22">Matching (in Banking) </span></a><a href="part115.htm#bookmark416" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Dopasowywanie (w bankowości) </span>– An abstract description of what banks do on a ‘macro’ level. They originate and manage as- set portfolios that share similar financial characteristics as the funding source, usually <i>deposits</i>. A bank’s matching is based upon the fundamental ‘matching principle’ in financial management (see the <i>Compendium of Finance</i>). For most borrowers, it is hazardous to have short term liabilities that can only be re- paid by longer term assets whose liquidity is ‘locked up’. Bankruptcy can result. Banks face similar constraints. Since deposits, which are typically <i>on demand </i>liabilities with floating interest rates, are matched or “aligned” with short-term, liquid, safe assets of the same currency. Bankers arrange the “flow through” or <i>intermediation </i>of deposit liabilities into consistent assets. Since deposits form the greater part of an economy’s money supply, this matching is serious busi-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">ness with public duties attached. A perfect asset to liability match will deal with three variables:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">1. Maturity – liabilities that will mature (i.e. be repaid) at the same time as loan assets mature.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">2. Interest rate – assets and liabilities will have proportionate floating or fixed rates.</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Currency – asset currencies will balance liability currencies.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">In an ideal world, the matched attributes would be exactly the same. There would be no exposure to a mismatch risk. However, an exact matching is seldom feasi- ble because of the operation of money markets. Loans, for example, can seldom be instantly repaid even if the bank has the right to call them in ‘on demand’. That said, deposit withdrawals en masse may never have to be honoured even if deposits are also on demand. In the absence of a panic, core deposits will tend to be stable and permanent. Thus maturity matching can be achieved through a process known as <i>maturity transformation</i>. A bank which could only exactly match assets to liabilities would in effect be an agent for depositors. It would have to seek to make profits solely on the strength of the value-added from its services as opposed to capitalising on market-wide opportunities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="234" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4066.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part926.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part928.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
