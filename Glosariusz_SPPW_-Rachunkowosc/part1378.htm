A fundamental debate in accounting is between pursuing uniformity (which facilitates comparisons) and permitting some flexibility (which may allow a more <i>fair presentation </i>if merited by a distinctive situation). The <i>Anglo-Saxon accounting tradition </i>tends to lean towards more flexibility on this issue. The inherent limitation of making direct comparisons is one reason why <i>financial analysis </i>often needs to address this issue<i>.</i></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3398">Compendium </a><a href="part268.htm#bookmark652" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Kompendium </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="p">Nothing to do with accounting or finance per se (although there is an etymological link in the word to the idea of “profit”), but perhaps relevant to what is in your hands.

It was Gravinsky’s <span class="s109">Compendium</span>, used mostly by students, as a crib... The compiler had combed through every monograph, expedition report, fragmentary outline and provisional account, even making excerpts of incidental comments. He had drawn up an inventory crammed with simplistic formulations, which grossly diminished the subtlety of the ideas it resumed… Adding up the sum of the intellectual efforts, it was tempting to think that surely one of the theories quoted must be correct, and that the thousands of listed hypothesis must each contain some grain of truth, could not be totally unrelated to the reality.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 182pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stanislaw Lem, <span class="s113">Solaris </span>(1961)</p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 62%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3399"><span class="s22">Compilation (Accountant’s) </span></a><a href="part1080.htm#bookmark2660" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part1080.htm#bookmark2660" class="s25">Zestawienie informacji finasowych (przez firmy </a><span class="s39">księgowe) </span><span class="s23">• </span>A service provided for <i>small businesses </i>that consists of putting together or</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">reviewing financial statements, often for <i>income tax </i>purposes. The accountant, either from an <i>audit </i>firm or <i>accounting service bureau</i>, will provide a modest degree of <i>assur- ance</i>. However, there is no explicit assurance as to conformity with <i>accounting standards </i>or fairness. There will usually be a disclaimer or warning to this effect. A compilation is even less reliable than a <i>review opinion </i>(which in turn is far from an <i>audit</i>). Yet, compared to having no third party involvement at all, it is comforting that a professional has at least looked at the numbers (“Comfort by association”).
