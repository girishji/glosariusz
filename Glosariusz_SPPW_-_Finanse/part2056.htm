Like many financial documents, certificates often had elaborate designs in order to discourage <i>forgery</i>. Other scripophilists collect old stocks for the history and background story behind their issuers. Compared to stamps or coins, an attraction of scripophily is the visual appeal of certificates hanging on a wall.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5366">Seat (Stock Exchange) </a><a href="part122.htm#bookmark310" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Członkostwo w giełdzie </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="p">The traditional reference to a dealer’s membership in a stock market or commodity exchange probably coming from the idea of having a “seat at the table”.

Secondary markets offer several valuable benefits to both issuers and investors. First, it provides a constant flow of infor- mation on the value of a security and, in turn, a “feedback loop” to manage- ment. This creates a market discipline mechanism that encourages competitive performance. As well, the liquidity of a secondary market offers an exit route from an otherwise locked-in investment position and thus reduces the risk of long term investing. To provide a source of liquidity, a secondary market needs organised exchanges and trading activity, often provided by a <i>market marker</i>. Moreover, since the secondary market is “one step removed” from issuers (vs.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">the primary market where investors have conducted their due diligence), to work effectively it also needs issuer reporting rules and regulatory oversight.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5368"><span class="s21">Secondary Offering </span></a><a href="part544.htm#bookmark1401" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Oferta na rynku wtórnym </span><span class="s22">• </span>A formal offer by existing shareholders to sell their equity shares to other investors, either as a <i>flotation </i>in the public markets or as a <i>private placement</i>. In contrast to a <i>primary offering, </i>a secondary offering has no impact on the amount of a firm’s capital. Rather, the ownership of the capital changes hands. A secondary offering is often utilised by original investors – such as venture capital firms or entrepreneurs – who want to “cash out” (i.e. extract unrealised paper profits) of a business that they have nurtured to grow.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="143" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7318.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2055.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2057.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
