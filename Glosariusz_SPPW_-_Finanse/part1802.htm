It was developed in USA by Professor Harry Markowitz in 1952 who later won the Nobel Prize in 1990 for his efforts. While MPT in founded upon complex mathematical formulations, there are four key ideas can be summarized as fol- lows:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><b>1. Diversification</b>: While a portfolio’s return will be a weighted average of in- dividual returns, the portfolio’s volatility of returns will not be additive. Rather, because of the relative behaviour of individual yield dynamics (called co-variance) much of their volatility will tend to offset against one another. The collective volatility of a group of investments will thus be reduced. The degree of offsetting will depend upon the strength and direction of co-vari- ances. Depending on how the security’s underlying business reacts to the <i>business cycle</i>, the relationship between yields can be perfectly opposite (co- variance of –1), independent (co-variance of 0) or perfectly in synch (co- variance of +1). So long as a portfolio is composed of investments with co- variances less than +1, diversification will occur and reduce overall volatility. While perfectly opposite co-variances are rare, most securities from differ- ent sectors have co-variances less than +1. Thus, after about 20 independent investments are put together, most of a portfolio’s risk will be eliminated except for a residual known as <i>systematic risk</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><b>2. Systematic Risk</b>: The residual risk in a portfolio cannot be avoided since it affects every investment in the same way. Diversification will not eliminate such risk. Its ultimate source is the economic business cycle that is impacting all economic players in varying degrees. However, individual investments will have varying degrees of sensitivity (called <i>beta </i>under the Capital Asset Pricing Model or CAPM) to this systematic risk.</p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">3. Returns and Risk Premiums<span class="p">: Individual investors cannot be compensated by the undiversified risk of specific shares because they are competing with other rational investors who are assumed to always be well diversified. The well-diversified investors are not bothered by the risk of an individual in- vestment and do not require any compensation for such non-existent risk. In an efficient market, the only risk that will be compensated is the degree of systematic risk inherent in an investment. CAPM in turns quantifies this return as a risk free return (a return for pure saving) plus a risk premium equal to the market’s compensation requirement for systematic risk adjusted by the security’s particular degree of sensitivity to such systematic risk.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="187" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_6403.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1801.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1803.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
