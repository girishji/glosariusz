An Apollo style of operation emphasises order and rules. Tasks are parcelled out logically, with stable, specific job descriptions and clear <i>accountability</i>, in a pyramid organisational structure with a hierarchy of authority. They are “Apollo” organisations because there is a god-like being at the top. While Apollo organisations are susceptible to becoming rigid and bureaucratic, they are very efficient and effective in a stable and predictable environment. Combined with a bank’s need to have tight internal controls to fulfil its fiduciary duties and to deal with risk, banks have tended to be classic Apollo organisations, although this is changing in response to competitive pressures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2629.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The role culture is often stereotyped as bureaucracy… Its patron god is Apollo, the god of reason; for this culture works by logic and by rationality.
