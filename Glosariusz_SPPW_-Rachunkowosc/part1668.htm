A “franchisee” will typically invest its own capital to independently operate a business but within a contractually agreed manner. In return for use of a brand name, being part of network and having access to proprietary know-how or products, it will pay a fee, either upfront or over time. A “franchisor” will generate revenue</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">from extracting fees from the franchisee or having the exclusive right to supply goods or services that in turn earn a profit. An accounting complexity with franchising is in <i>rev- enue recognition</i>, particular the initial fee. Is it earned immediately for start-up or a charge for future services? (In which case it should defer revenue until services are provided over time.) (Word roots: from the Old French “franc” = free; later evolved in 18<span class="s60">th </span>century to idea of free to vote and then authorisation to carry out commercial activity in 19<span class="s60">th </span>century.)</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 62%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4112"><span class="s22">Fraud Detection by Auditors </span></a><a href="part1003.htm#bookmark2474" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part1003.htm#bookmark2474" class="s25">Wykrywanie nadużyć gospodarczych przez </a><span class="s39">rewidentów </span><span class="s23">• </span>Since the <i>economic crime </i>of <i>fraud </i>or error may materially affect the</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">financial statements<span class="p">, its prevention and detection is of concern to both </span>shareholders <span class="p">and </span>auditors <span class="p">alike. The dilemma is that fraud can be extremely hard for outsiders to detect. Collusion between insiders (an “inside job”) may circumvent </span>internal controls<span class="p">. Documentation, which auditors often must treat as reliable third party </span>audit evidence<span class="p">, can be forged. Making matters more difficult is the very nature of modern business. Competition in the free market puts greater pressure on </span>performance<span class="p">. Employers are less paternalistic; employees are in turn less loyal. Globalisation involves decentralisation and more complex transactions spanning several jurisdictions. Technological change has resulted in the development of the “paperless office”. Since fraud is an “inside job”, its prevention, of necessity, must be the primary responsibility of </span>management<span class="p">. It cannot be the auditor’s primary function to prevent fraud and error. That said, audits can be a deter- rent to fraud. Moreover, auditors cannot be oblivious to fraud. Under most </span>audit stan- dards <span class="p">they are obliged to consider the possibility of fraud as an </span>audit risk<span class="p">. In all, we have an example of “healthy ambiguity”. Apportioning blame often boils down to a matter of degree. In extreme cases (see </span>Enron<span class="p">), auditors have been negligent. The two terms “rea- sonable expectation” and “material misstatements” are central to defining the auditors’ responsibilities. Often, these can only be resolved in a court of law. Depending on the type of fraud (e.g. </span>money laundering <span class="p">in the banking sector), there may also be a statutory duty for the auditor to report a fraud to either an industry regulator or to criminal authorities. Apart from the statutory audit, auditors may also get involved in fraud investigations in their roles as </span>forensic accountants<span class="p">.
