While shareholders must have a degree of trust and confidence in “their” managers, there are several checks and balances designed to address the agency problem:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s22">◆ </span>effective <i>corporate governance </i>by representatives of shareholder interests;</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s22">◆ </span>transparent accounting <span class="p">practices which accurately measure enterprise </span>perfor-</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">mance<span class="p">;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s22">◆ </span>independent auditors who will fight for <i>fair disclosure</i>;</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s22">◆ </span>compensation schemes (e.g. <i>stock option </i>plans) which harmonise managers’</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">interests with owners;</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s22">◆ </span>institutional <span class="p">and </span>strategic investors <span class="p">who will pressure management to deliver</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">satisfactory results;</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">open markets and free trade which puts pressure on domestic players from</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">globalisation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">The agency problem is important because professional managers who are separated from owners control so much of a modern economy. This was recognised as long ago as 1932 by two economists, Adolph Berle and Gardiner Means, in their seminal work “The Modern Corporation and Private Property”. It can be argued that corporate <i>debt </i>plays a valuable role in the agency problem by eliminating excess cash and by creating the need for the financial discipline of <i>repayment</i>.

Thus, a lawyer, investment banker, accountant or management consultant can be exposed to the illegalities and third party lawsuits of their clients. This is in spite of their role being ostensibly confined to giving advice to others, be it management or investors. (The laws of negligence determine the auditor’s duty to shareholders and creditors, regardless of whether the auditor has a contractual relationship with them). Aider and Abettor rules tend to spread the net of accountability wide, encouraging a disgruntled party to sue anybody with deep pockets. When the US Congress passed the Private Secu- rities Litigation Reform Act (1995) they were trying to limit perceived abuses of frivolous lawsuits. Alas, Wall Street scandals such as Enron, are tending to bring back Aider and Abettor rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for example, imposes criminal penalties for certain false representations even if they are perhaps errors in judgement. Common sense and fairness should tell us that advisers may indeed bear some responsibility for their clients’ damaging acts. But this should be tem- pered by a comparatively larger burden of responsibility on those who actually make decisions and take actions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="115" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4072.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1143.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1145.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
