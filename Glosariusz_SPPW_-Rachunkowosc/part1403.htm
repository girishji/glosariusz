In the case of law, it represents a healthy sharing of risk that helps prevent going to court with a weak case. On the other hand, it can lead to “ambulance chasing” behaviour and excessive litigation. In the case of an auditor, a contingency fee (i.e. <i>audit fees </i>would vary depending upon results of the audit) would obviously create a <i>conflict of interest </i>with regard to being impartial. This prohibition applies to both the amount and timing of fees. Auditors should not have any large, outstanding liabilities from their own clients.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3462"><span class="s22">Contingent Assets </span></a><a href="part16.htm#bookmark36" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Aktywa warunkowe </span><span class="s23">• </span>A “possible asset” that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.

For example, a company may be purchased with a contractual agree- ment that the vendor will receive a share of future <i>profits </i>of the sold entity. Such an agree- ment may facilitate a sale in conditions of uncertainty where it is difficult to come up with an attractive price for both parties (i.e. “we’ll pay you for what it’s worth when we find out</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">what it’s worth”). Or, another example of contingent consideration could be a final price based on a third party valuation (“we’ll pay what a expert thinks is fair value”). For both buyer and seller, such agreements raise complex accounting issues of cost and revenue rec- ognition respectively. Generally, the rule is that future adjustments should be recognised as soon as they are probable and can be measured reliably.
