The trading aspect and its implications (e.g. short term holdings, gains/losses on frequent buy/sell transac- tions, continuous mark-to-market pricing etc.) contrasts with the <i>intermediation </i>activities (e.g. originate, monitor and control, hold to maturity, relationship build- ing, cross-selling etc.) of a <i>commercial bank</i>. The invention of credit derivatives effectively allowed credit exposures to be traded, both for speculative and for hedging purposes. For the first time, credit exposure could be shorted i.e. gains would be made if a borrower unexpectedly defaulted. Credit trading also allows credit risk premiums to be better quantified i.e. the quoted spreads on credit de- fault swaps reflect market perceptions of default risk. In all, credit trading has fun- damentally altered the way credit risk is both perceived and managed (see quote below). See also <i>originate and sell model </i>and <i>originate and hold model.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3354.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">[When] financial engineers concocted ways to <b>trade </b>de- rivatives linked to credit it proved to be a revolution that changed the way Wall Street worked forever.
