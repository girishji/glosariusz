We’re reminded that a mass of factual data is not the same thing as distilled “information” which helps serve to make a decision. The amount of time, effort and resources invested in capturing such information will depend on <i>credit risk </i>and how well a lender already <i>knows the borrower</i>. For example, a loan to a new, untried SME customer would usu- ally merit a thorough credit investigation by most prudent banks.</p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 72%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2111"><span class="s22">Credit/Lending Authority </span></a><a href="part168.htm#bookmark513" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part168.htm#bookmark513" class="s24">Kompetencje w zakresie udzielania kre- </a>dytów <a href="part505.htm#bookmark1492" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a>Uprawnienia kredytowe <span class="s65">– </span><span class="p">The amount of discretion given to bank-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">ers to <i>authorise </i>credit decisions (see <i>authoriser function, credit</i>) based on a delega- tion of house limits to those qualified to exercise their own <i>banker’s judgement</i>. To achieve portfolio volumes, a bank must process many transactions. Additionally, much of the <i>credit analysis </i>must be at the interface with the borrower. Since expedi- ency necessitates decentralised decision-making, a bank will parcel out limits based on the seniority, experience and track record of staff. The credit authority is typical- ly defined in terms of exposure (see quote below). For example, a branch manager might have authority up to, say, $100,000 while a vice-president could approve, say,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3289.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">$1 million. Abalance needstobefound in such delegation. Valuable internal control of checks and balances are essential, whatever the form of the lending authority, but theybecome harder tomanageas individuals arefreeto commit thebank’s resources within their own limits. Furthermore, <i>rogue lenders </i>may chose to abuse their limits by flaunting <i>credit policy</i>. At the same time, widely distributing credit authority is a form of <i>diversification</i>, which avoids centralised but bad they may corrupt the whole bank. Decentralised credit authority also allows more decisions to be made ‘on the spot’, avoiding <i>bureaucracy </i>and speeding up the decision turnaround pro- cess. Prudent bankers are very careful with the use of their credit authority. It is an instance where they will be held fully accountable for their decisions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3290.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Exposure is usually the basis on which banks decide how to allocate <b>lending authority</b>; if the exposure is large, it re- quires a higher degree of judgement to decide that the risk is acceptable.
