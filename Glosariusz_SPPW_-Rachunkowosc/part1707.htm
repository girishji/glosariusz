The CGU write down is applied first against allocated goodwill and then to the specific assets themselves pro- rata. Testing for goodwill impairment is a healthy discipline for management: poorly thought-out and badly executed acquisitions can “come home to roost” with a sudden and large write-down.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 62%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4205">Government Grants (Accounting for) </a><a href="part125.htm#bookmark308" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part125.htm#bookmark308" class="s25">Dotacje państwowe (rozliczanie </a><span class="s39">w rachunkowości) </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="p">A government grant (or “assistance” or “subsidy”) is a transfer of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">resources (monetary or non-monetary) to an enterprise in return for past or future com- pliance to specified operating or investing conditions. Grants can come in many guises. They can be continuously rendered as relief from ongoing expenses (“income grants” or “operating subsidies”) or as one-time payments (“capital grant”). The latter includes assis- tance to purchase assets or a reduction of a liability owing or a forgivable loan (see also <i>de-recognition</i>). Grants can also come indirectly by way of infrastructure investments, <i>guarantees </i>or the provision of free services. Government grants are ideally provided to accomplish some public policy objective such as employment, industrial development or research and development etc. Note that benefits that are generally available to all enter- prises (such as government services, income <i>tax holidays</i>, <i>investment tax credits</i>, acceler- ated <i>capital cost allowances </i>and reduced <i>income tax </i>rates etc.) are not considered to be grants. Moreover, government participation in the ownership of the enterprise is not a grant (although a significant ownership stake merits <i>disclosure </i>in the <i>notes</i>)<i>. </i>Government grants pose two basic issues for accounting:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">1. <i>Transparency </i>of the grant: in assessing <i>management’s </i>job performance, <i>earnings quality </i>and the enterprise’s future earnings sustainability, shareholders want to iso- late the impact of a grant on a firm’s commercial financial <i>performance</i>. In the case of state owned enterprises, the public should be able to see how much the enterprise is taking from the public purse.</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">2. Identifying whether the enterprise has fulfiled its obligations in order to fully qualify for the grant; this is a focus for both the government and shareholders; non-compli- ance to conditions might trigger either a withdrawal of the grant or, worse, repay- ment of monies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Accounting for government grants boils down to an <span class="s27">income recognition </span>issue. Three broad approaches may be used to deal with government grants:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>receipt approach </b>recognises the grant as <i>income </i>when received. This is the simplest way and, from the government’s perspective, perhaps gives the grant the most incen- tive power. However, it is not in accordance with the <i>accrual accounting </i>assump- tion and would only be acceptable if no basis existed for allocating a grant to periods other than the one in which it was received.</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>equity approach </b>has a grant credited directly to shareholders’ interests as <i>contributed surplus </i>thereby bypassing the <i>income statement</i>.
