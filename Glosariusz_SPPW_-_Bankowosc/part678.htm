The term tends to be used rather loosely and often needs clarification (see quote below). A basic distinction is debt capital provided by lenders who want their money back with interest and equity capital provided by investors who want permanent ownership in order to earn profits. Both can be used to “capitalise” a business. Debt capital, reflecting the disposition of lenders, can come in many forms: short term (up to 1 year); medium term (1–3 years), long term (more than 5 years). Equity capital can also have different guises: share capital (owned by investors), flight (nervous about committing), friendly (willing to tolerate low performance), venture (willing to take risk), <i>start-up </i>(willing to begin a new business), sweat equity (contributed through labour not money) and smart money (shrewd backers).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2980.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Note that short-term debt (trade credit or bank loans <i>on demand</i>) is a source of <i>liquidity </i>and is not generally considered to be “capital”. In the case of a bank a subtle distinction exists. Depositors don’t regard their money as a form of debt capital (which is their legal status) but rather as tantamount to funds ‘held in trust’. For this reason, <i>bank capital </i>is always thought of in terms of an ownership stake and, unlike a commercial enterprise, never includes debt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="421" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2981.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If we were to divide <b>capital </b>into classes, we should say that it was blind capital in the hands of hoarders who cannot em- ploy it, loanable capital in those of bankers, and intelligent capital when at the disposal of intelligent men of industry.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walter Bagehot, <i>Monetary Schemes</i>, 1856</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If we were to divide <b>capital </b>into classes, we should say that it was blind capital in the hands of hoarders who cannot em- ploy it, loanable capital in those of bankers, and intelligent capital when at the disposal of intelligent men of industry.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walter Bagehot, <i>Monetary Schemes</i>, 1856</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If we were to divide <b>capital </b>into classes, we should say that it was blind capital in the hands of hoarders who cannot em- ploy it, loanable capital in those of bankers, and intelligent capital when at the disposal of intelligent men of industry.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Walter Bagehot, <i>Monetary Schemes</i>, 1856</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="55" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2982.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part677.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part679.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
