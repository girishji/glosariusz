In effect, saying an asset is worth some- thing because an expert says so. To be credible, the appraiser should be experienced, professionally qualified and independent. The appraisal should be in writing with an explanation for the reasoning behind the estimate. The appraisal should also ideally use</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">valuation methods endorsed by the <i>International Valuation Standards</i>. Almost by defini- tion, appraisals are seldom needed when a ready <i>market price </i>can be referenced. No one needs an appraisal on, say, Shell Oil’s bonds; we may ready find a quotation in the bond market. Rather, appraisals are needed when there is no <i>active market</i>. An estimate must be made of what the asset would fetch if it were put on the market with “willing” parties (i.e. patient, informed and not desperate). For example, real estate property, by virtue of its unique location and special purpose, may have a market value that can only be firmly established by transacting a sale. However, in lieu of selling the asset, an appraiser may be able to make an informed judgement based on comparable transactions in the market, benchmarks, replacement costs etc. Because of estimation error, market volatility (which can decrease as well as increase prices) and the fact that market value is before costs of selling, transaction taxes etc., appraised value should be, by design, consciously conserva- tive. In theory, any asset could have an appraised value. However, in practice, appraisals are confined to real estate property, an asset class that tends to have more determinable values.
