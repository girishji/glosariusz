This contrasts to “classical” economic theory in which capital, land and labour vied for positions based on their relative scarcity. The term came from an American economist Thorstein Veblen who is best remem- bered for coining the notion of “conspicuous consumption” (over-indulgence by the rich for the sake of gaining social status). Veblen, observing life in the “robber baron” age of J.P. Morgan, argued that engineers and production people</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="417" height="252" alt="image" src="Image_5327.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moving the World</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moving the World</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Moving the World</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">– in his view, these “industrial experts” were the only “real” producers in an economy – had become subservient to accountants and financiers. Considering how American industry was consolidating into predatory oligopolies, there was much truth in this. The public backlash was the “trust busting” of the Teddy Roosevelt administration. Many felt that finance capitalism had returned in the 1980s when the financier’s tools of the trade – <i>junk bonds</i>, <i>take-overs </i>and <i>corpo- rate restructuring </i>– seemed to be re-engineering corporate America. In this frenzied, high testosterone world of Wall Street, bankers, at least richly paid investment bankers, seemed to indeed be the “masters of the universe”. With the ascendancy of e-commerce, computers now seem to rule. Despite a common bankers’ image of often wielding great power, the role of finance in a healthy economy needs to be kept in perspective. Allocating capital to its best yields puts the finance function in a subordinate role in a fully competitive, free mar- ket economy. The real power lies with consumers, producers and the capital markets, all of who are impersonal and dictated by performance. In the global New Economy, with its worldwide playing field, this is even truer.
