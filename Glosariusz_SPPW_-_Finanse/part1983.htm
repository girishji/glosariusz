Commercial leases provide a long term, stable source of income. In the case of residential apartments, REITS can be counter-cyclical to the private homeowner’s market as “bad home owners become good renters”. REITS were first developed in the USA in the 1960s where they have a large market capitali- zation of $340 billion (“The Economist”, July 29, 2006, p. 73). The investment vehicle is now migrating to other countries as enabling legislation (reference: tax treatment and securities regulation) is put in place.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5176"><span class="s21">Real Estate Property </span></a><a href="part493.htm#bookmark1272" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Nieruchomość </span><span class="s22">• </span>Land and its immovable physical property such as improvements, landscaping and buildings. Real estate (from the Latin “res/rei” = thing) is also referred to as “real property”, “realty” or “im- movable property”. Its permanence contrasts with personal property (e.g. mov- able and depreciating things such as machinery, vehicles, money). In industrial- ized economies, real estate assets typically represent one of the largest single stores of wealth (for most households, their home is their most valuable asset; their mortgage is their largest debt). Although there is the notion of “squatter’s rights”, real estate can only fulfill its full potential value if there is an institu- tional <i>infrastructure </i>that assures property rights, including some kind of a sys- tem of title registration. (Economists have recognized that the lack of effective real estate laws can be a significant barrier to development in emerging mar-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="414" height="95" alt="image" src="Image_7056.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investment Advice</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investment Advice</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investment Advice</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">kets). Lenders are attracted to <i>real estate financing </i>because of the safety of mort- gages as collateral security. This can be a mixed blessing. Monetized property values can be a source of business capital (see <i>start-up</i>) and boost consumer confidence (see <i>wealth effect</i>). However, <i>economic bubbles </i>are often caused by over-lending into “hot” real estate markets whose demand is artificially driven by lending.
