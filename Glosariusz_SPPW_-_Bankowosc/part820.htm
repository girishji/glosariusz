An examina- tion is <i>confidential</i>, even secret least adverse results cause a panic. To avoid ‘cat and mouse’ gamesmanship, bank management, like a sinner in confession, is expected to be frank, honest and repentant about any hidden problems. Un- der some jurisdictions (e.g. British), the shareholder’s auditor is also obliged to report any problems they come across to the banking regulator. Should a bank fail to make the grade, the regulators have the authority to close down a bank, usually after allowing a remedial self-help period. While examinations are perhaps a ‘necessary evil’, they are also an example of regulatory burden (see quote below). The challenge of external observers is to figure out what’s really going on inside a complex operation like a bank. More effective safeguards of banking soundness are internalised: e.g. a healthy <i>credit culture</i>, an effective internal audit function and robust <i>corporate governance.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3583.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At any given time, we at JP Morgan Chase have 75–135 on-</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">-site, full-time examiners from the OCC, Federal Reserve and FDIC; the U.K. FSA and other regulators have still more examiners overseeing our overseas operations.
