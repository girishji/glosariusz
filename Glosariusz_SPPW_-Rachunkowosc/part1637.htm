Sensibly, these are carried at cost less any <span class="s27">asset impairment</span>. Alternatively, liabilities carried to maturity are valued at their face or nominal amount. In contrast, other financial instruments (e.g. <span class="s27">marketable securities</span>) are, by their nature, typically traded. Or certain financial instruments (e.g. <span class="s27">derivatives</span>), while not traded, have values (measured in terms of <span class="s27">net present value </span>of expected cash flow) that fluctuate with market conditions according to the linkages built into their contractual terms. These are more appropriately valued at <span class="s27">fair value </span>with <span class="s27">mark-to-mar- ket </span>recognition of income from valuation changes. The accounting can be summarised as follows (see table on p. 50).</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For such items as cash, loans, trade obligations and long term debt, the accounting is both obvious and clear. The necessity of detailed accounting for financial instruments arises because of the inherent complexities of such synthetic things as derivatives. Prior to explicit <span class="s27">accounting standards </span>for financial instruments, many derivatives tended to be treated as <span class="s27">off balance sheet items</span>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 62%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4031">Financial Management Accounting (FMA) Software </a><a href="part537.htm#bookmark1302" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part537.htm#bookmark1302" class="s25">Oprogramowanie </a><span class="s39">do prowadzenia rachunkowości finansowo-zarządczej </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="s26">Computer account-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ing systems which allow foreign subsidiaries to comply with both local regulatory <i>finan- cial accounting </i>standards and home office <i>accounting policies </i>even if the two are on a different basis. As well, <i>management accounting </i>information can often be generated to assist in international decision-making. FMA packages facilitate international business, particularly in emerging markets where local ruled oriented regulations can be complex, alien and onerous to comply with.
