Arguably a better description would simply be ‘speculation’, a bad word if you are a banker but praiseworthy if you are a hedge fund. The use of the word proprietary also connotes “private”, inferring the use of your own unique techniques or market insights. Thus, we also have the term “pro- prietary models” which are methods, often using complex computer driven for- mulas, for the valuation of transactions and position of financial instruments in over-the-counter markets. Trading for your own account is a natural exten- sion of conducting customer trades. Active engagement in a trading market naturally leads to spotting <i>arbitrage </i>opportunities. Additionally, a bank may be a market-maker in chosen securities and thus have to hold positions that it may either gain or lose by. In such instances, any trading profits are an offshoot of the core activity of acting as agents on behalf of customers and earning revenue by charging transaction fees. Proprietary trading is much more pro-active. It seeks trading profits in own right. It is entirely appropriate for a hedge fund whose raison d’etre is to take calculated gambles. It is tolerable for an investment bank comfortable with how markets operate. Intermediating commercial banks are perhaps another story. Such trading tends to ancillary (see quote below). For example, in 2008 Scotiabank’s “trading revenues” (which would capture trading on its own account) were $188 million or less than 5% of its pre-tax income. In contrast, it earned $760 million in “Investment management, brokerage and trust services” acting as an agent for third party customers (ref: <i>Consolidated</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="113" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4340.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part998.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1000.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
