The word is rather formal. Compared to its alternative description as a “company” or a “business”, it also conveys certain connotations. Typically, (but not always) financial institutions are large and regulated with the implicit en- dorsement of a government or regulator. In the case of banks, they are even more intimately linked to governments via deposit insurance and access to a liquidity backstop from a <i>central bank</i>. Financial institutions are usually inter- mediary (see <i>intermediating</i>) as opposed to acting as agents of behalf of others. Hence, asset management firms such as mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity funds are generally not described as such. <i>Access to capital </i>from financial</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">institutions can be contrasted to money coming via the public capital markets.
