Typically, it refers to consumer banking products such as credit cards etc. For example, the stated interest rate might be 15% but “extra” services such as late payment or excess over line charges might make actual, all-in pricing much high- er especially if the bank is pro-actively <i>cross-selling </i>to encourage their usage as a “revenue enhancement” ploy. While caveat emptor (“let the buyer beware”) ap- plies to banking as much as other purchases, the inherent fiduciary trust involved in banking means more transparent and plain language is needed to restore fair market competition. In the USA, one consequence of the Credit Crisis of</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">2007–2009 was the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency which sought to discourage such predatory pricing practices.

Clients may value this “one-stop” service. Furthermore, in the spirit of <i>merchant banking</i>, banks are putting their “money where their mouth is” (i.e. if a bank advises that it<b>’</b>s good deal, it should also be prepared to invest). When banks put up equity they are essentially competing with private equity funds. However, banks will tend to pile up a considerable amount of undiversified risk this way. This may not be a good idea since leveraged buy-outs are inherently risky. Ad- ditionally, the bias of their advisory services may blind them to the true risks. Investment bankers often rationalise such calculated risk-taking as only offer-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">ing temporary <i>bridge </i>financing (both for debt and equity). A swift subsequent exit will presumably limit their exposure to temporary <i>underwriting </i>so long as they don’t get caught by a surprise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="221" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4916.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1125.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1127.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
