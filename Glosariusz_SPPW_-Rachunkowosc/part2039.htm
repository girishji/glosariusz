As befits any professional status, auditors and accountants are typically required to meet certain minimum standards of technical competency, know-how and <i>ethical standards</i>. These will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but usually involve some version of the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s41">◆ </span><b>Formal education: </b>A university degree with specific business course credits or gra- duation from an accounting program. (Not all <i>professional accounting bodies </i>have this requirement; some (e.g. ICAEW and ACCA) will allow university education to be replaced by an extended apprenticeship programme);</p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="s40">Practical Experience: </span><span class="p">Apprenticeship work in a recognized training office under the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">supervision of experienced accountants.

As with any profession, there may be some truth to this, although it may be more as a consequential result rather than by advance design. However, for auditors to fulfil their duties to the <span class="s27">public interest</span>, there must be a significant level of public confidence and trust in the profession.
