For example, an overfunded <i>pension plan </i>has more assets invested than actuarial liabilities. The overfunded amount can either be treated as a “safety cushion” in the event that estimates on investment returns and/or future payouts prove to be overly optimistic or the overfunding can be seen as a “clear surplus” that could be safely withdrawn and redeployed elsewhere. This may or may not be feasible depending whether pension and la- bour regulations allow any surpluses to be withdrawn. Overfunding can also refer to a situation when a government issues more debt than it needs to fund its operating deficits.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4877"><span class="s21">Oversubscribed Share Issue </span></a><a href="part469.htm#bookmark1207" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Nadsubskrypcja </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">An issue of securities </span>where the demand by interested investors is greater than the number of shares being offered to the market. For example, if there are 500 applications for 100 shares, then the issue would be four times (500–100 = 400 <i>vs. </i>100) oversub- scribed. Oversubscription suggests that the issue price is too low and will like- ly rise once trading begins in the secondary market. Since the issuer does not get the benefit of such higher share prices, an oversubscription can be an <i>un- derwriting </i>issue. While a modest amount of excess demand will help raise cap- ital, an excessive amount makes it costlier than it need be. Oversubscription can also describe a share buyback or take-over attempt in which more securi- ties are offered for sale than the purchaser has agreed to buy.

The words roots come from the early 19<span class="s168">th </span>century American practice of conducting such transactions across a bank counter. The largest OTC market is the USA’s <i>NASDAQ</i>. OTC trades are typi- cally for amounts that are either too big or specialised for there to be enough buyers and sellers for an open bid and ask auction process. The absence of investor protection from a regulated exchange means that most OTC players are large, well-informed institutions.
