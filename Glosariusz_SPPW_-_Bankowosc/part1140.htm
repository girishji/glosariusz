In countries where anti-usury laws exist it is illegal to charge interest beyond a specified maximum. Usury initially was a religious notion with roots in medieval thought (see quote below). Jesus said: “Lend nothing hoping for nothing” (Luke 6:35-6). Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy </i>relegated usurers to the “Seventh Circle of Hell” alongside murderers. This contrasted with Jewish practices faith that allowed interest on loans, but only to Gentiles (e.g. Deuteronomy 23:20: “Unto a stranger thou may lend upon interest; but unto they brother thou shalt not lend on interest”). Ap- plication of this distinction was one source of the animosity between the two cultures. Jewish moneylenders drew fire because they dealt in small loans to the general populace. The Catholic Church banned usury in the 14<span class="s342">th </span>century.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Christian lenders, observing a breach in the law, got around the problem by ensuring that principal sums borrowed were less that sums repaid (hence the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="86" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4964.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1232 <span class="s28">Utility Banking</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="417" height="265" alt="image" src="Image_4965.png"/></span></p><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Usury</p><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Usury</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s61" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Usury</p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">origins of the discount process). The freedom to charge interest was crucial to the development of credit and may account for the prominent role of Jewish people in banking in early Europe (ref: <i>Europe </i>by Norman Davies, p. 416). The Italian <i>Medici </i>would get around the problem by charity and patronage of the arts. Later, Protestant values, with their “spirit of capitalism”, would accommo- date the legitimate needs of the lender to charge for the “rent” of capital.

Since utilities tend to offer reliable but unexciting returns, bankers and bank shareholders may not enthusiastically embrace the idea. The public policy argument against the utility business model is that it confines banks to a narrow path which sacrifices valuable contributions to an economy if in fact other firms cannot fill the void. It may also quash legiti- mate synergies between “plain vanilla” intermediation and more exotic trading activities that can genuinely benefit a bank’s customers.
