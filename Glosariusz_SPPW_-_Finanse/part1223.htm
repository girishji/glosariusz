Because the financial reporting model does not attempt to measure fair value so much as record past transactions, BVPS will not necessarily match the forward-oriented valuation of the stock market. That said, it is useful to measure the difference, especially if it is large, in order to gain a reference point for share valuation purposes (i.e. if the gap is significant, analysts will seek to explain why). As well, shares with a low BVPS compared to share price are, all things being equal, usually considered better value stock by virtue of there be- ing little paid for <i>economic goodwill</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3183"><span class="s21">Boot Strapping </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part78.htm#bookmark200" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Boot Strapping </span>(żargon) <span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">An acquisition </span>strategy of buying a company with a lower <i>price-earnings ratio</i>.

Indeed, bottom fishers will purposely look for companies in <i>financial distress</i>.

Thus there is no need to <i>underwrite </i>the transaction. Normally, it would be in the best interests of most securities issuers to have their shares distributed widely, letting the bid and offer process of the market set a maximum price. However, in some instances it is advantageous to sell directly to investors. Investors will often be <i>market makers </i>who may subsequently “trickle” the shares out into a broader market in the hopes of earning a capital gain. A flaw in bought deals relates to existing shareholders when they cannot exercise <i>pre-emptive rights</i>. The bought deal is a <i>financial innovation </i>that height- ened competition and eliminated market risk from the issuer. In the USA, bought deals are facilitated by <i>SEC’s </i>Rule 415.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="42" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4432.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1222.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1224.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
