For example, a <i>commercial paper </i>commitment requires a bank to buy an issuer’s debt in the event that the money market does not. In these roles, a bank is providing a kind of insurance in the event that the market does not behave as anticipated. A borrower might not be welcomed in the market if its credit rating fell or because of some imbal- ance in the overall market, possibly a <i>credit crunch</i>. Standby commitments put banks in the position of being contingently liable and raise the issue of <i>bank capital adequacy </i>to deal with the possibility of usage. The use of standby com- mitments are “half way houses” on the way to full <i>securitisation </i>whereby bor- rowers can deal with the capital markets with banks only acting as <i>originators</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Standby commitments are also known as “back-up lines” or “swing-lines”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3056"><span class="s22">Standstill </span></a><a href="part543.htm#bookmark1558" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Wstrzymanie się </span>– A voluntary agreement, outside of formal <i>insol- vency </i>proceedings, amongst creditors and lenders to collectively refrain from exercising their <i>creditor rights. </i>A standstill is a collective <i>forbearance </i>which gives all parties a “breathing space” to sort out financial difficulties in order to prevent a pre-mature and destructive “race for the exit” by lenders who must otherwise protect their individual <i>security interests</i>. Since new lenders or inves- tors do not want to waste their effort by having others bring the company down, standstills are critical if fresh rescue money is to be provided to salvage a bor- rower’s going concern.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="221" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4783.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1089.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1091.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
