It is sometimes used with debit cards as a “courtesy” to save customer embarrassment from being denied small transactions. Normally, banks will de- cline debit-card purchases when the account’s available balance is insufficient to cover a purchase amount. There is a “bright-line” cut-off. The shadow line in ef- fect authorises overdrafts, but does so with no warning that an overdraft is in pro- gress. In the meantime, a standing order in a customer agreement may allow an overdraft fee to be levied. This can lead to perverse situations whereby a customer purchasing a two-dollar coffee could unwittingly incur a $30-plus overdraft fee. While overdrafts are high–risk, a cagey bank may calculate that it can make more</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">money in overdraft fees than it would ever lose due to uncollectible debts. In 2010, the <i>tricks and traps </i>pricing of shadow lines became a consumer rights issue in the USA especially when used in conjunction with abusive posting sequences. An equivalent to a shadow line of credit between banks is a “non-notified” line, although it is intended for the management of settlement risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="78" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4714.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1072.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1074.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
