A “roll rate” is the movement into different arrears categories, sometimes called “buckets”. For instance, while most loans which are only 0<b>–</b>30 days late will revert back to a “current” status, some will “roll” forward into becoming 30–60 days late; in turn, some of those will recover but more will roll into 60–90 days and so on. An average roll rate for each bucket, which smoothes out aberrations, is built up over time. The past pattern of roll rates is then used to predict the propensity of loans in particular buckets to migrate towards an ultimate loss experience. Based on knowing how loans in various buckets tend to end up, loan loss provisions can be estimated based on how old are uncol-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">lected debts. Roll rate analysis is based on compelling logic: the longer a debt goes uncollected, the higher the probability that it will remain unpaid in the future. Ultimately, a portion (which neither collection agents nor courts can recover) of such debts will have to be <i>written off</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2949"><span class="s22">Rothschild, House of (&amp; Banking History) </span></a><a href="part425.htm#bookmark1342" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part425.htm#bookmark1342" class="s24">Rotschildowie (a historia </a><span class="s60">bankowości) </span><b>– </b>A prestigious 19<span class="s342">th </span>century <i>merchant bank </i>known for its great</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">wealth, political connections and reputedly powerful influence. Between 1815 and 1914, the house was the largest bank in the world (ref: <i>The House of Roths- child </i>by Ferguson, p. 3). The roots of the Rothschilds (German for “Red Shield”) go back to the medieval Judengasse (Jewish quarter) of Frankfurt am Main. In the late 18<span class="s342">th </span>century, their banking operations evolved from earlier prosperity in trading, especially after one son, Nathan, settled permanently in England. Their ability to handle remittances to the Continent during the Napoleonic Wars (to finance the Continental army and its allies) was their initial breakthrough. They earned handsome profits on both the gold transfer commissions paid by the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="237" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4610.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1148 <span class="s28">Rothschild, House of (&amp; Banking History)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4611.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">British government and foreign exchange <i>arbitrage </i>(since the gold transactions would move currency prices). A legend (which is perhaps a myth) was that they also made a fortune by stock-market speculation upon getting early news of the victory at the Battle of Waterloo via their own carrier pigeon service. The Rothschilds consolidated their financial might in international bond market, <i>private banking </i>(for Europe’s aristocratic elite), <i>investment banking </i>and indus- trial development (especially railways). Relative to their time, the Rothschilds accumulated immense wealth. Even the mighty <i>Bank of England </i>at one time needed to borrow from them. The famous quote by the poet Heinrich Heine (1841) that “Money is the god of our time and Rothschild is his prophet” con- veyed the public’s awe. How did one family business become so successful? Of course, the Rothschilds were undoubtedly smart, hardworking and often lucky, but they also had an edge. Throughout the 19th century, the Rothschilds ran a cohesive partnership of five brothers in London and the Continent that was precursor to a multinational corporation. Such a “financial federation” enjoyed close-knit cross-border capability that was able to exploit many lucrative ar- bitrage opportunities in the budding industrial age of globalisation. Many myths (e.g. social ascent, behind-the-scenes political power and their role as Jewish People) and prejudices (e.g. the <i>Gnomes of Zurich</i>) surrounded them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4612.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>Rothschilds </b>are the wonders of modern banking...
