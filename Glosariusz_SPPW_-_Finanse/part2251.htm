For example, this could occur just before a widely traded stock <i>index option </i>expires. The “triple witching hour” occurs when three expiry dates coincide: stock index futures, options on such contracts and options on individual stocks in the index. To avoid witching hour volatility, exchanges often spread out expiries. The idea of a “witching hour” comes from the notion that unpleasant forces are at work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="418" height="286" alt="image" src="Image_8015.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5877"><span class="s21">Women in Finance </span></a><a href="part343.htm#bookmark878" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Kobiety w finansach </span><span class="s22">• </span>A general, worldwide trend in finance is that there is higher participation by women in the labour market. This is facilitated by the rise of technology and service jobs in the modern economy. In the USA, for instance, there are almost as many women working as men (we are excluding the unpaid household work). How are women faring in financial activities? It would seem rather well, especially considering that they may have innate advantages. Studies have shown that American companies with more women in senior management earned a higher return on equity (Catalyst Con- sulting). In investing, women are capable of making consistently better deci- sions than men (Digital Look website). Women are less likely to <i>churn </i>invest- ments and overcommit to risky investments (Merrill Lynch).
