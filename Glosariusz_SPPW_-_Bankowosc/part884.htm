Most contracts are, by nature, irrevocable. In banking, irrevocable terms might be applied to a <i>letter of credit </i>to make it a permanent and reliable, at least until its expiry date. Or, draw downs on a committed line of credit might only be denied if the borrower was in default. Word roots: Latin “revocare” = “to call again” in English.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3889.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2476"><span class="s22">It’s a Wonderful Life </span></a><span class="s52">(1946 Movie) </span><a href="part483.htm#bookmark1450" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s154">To wspaniałe życie </span><span class="s32">(film z 1946 r.) </span>– A beloved Hollywood Christmas-time movie starring Jimmy Stewart who plays the honest and honourable banker in a small town <i>community bank </i>fighting the bad guy, the cold-hearted Potter (see <i>bad banker</i>). After the despondent banker confesses to a mob of nervous and angry depositors that his bank cannot re- turn all their money <i>on demand </i>(see <i>confidence game</i>), he contemplates taking his own life. Then an angel intervenes (if only life was like this!). The banker, the bank, the community’s confidence and spirit are all miraculously restored through the benevolent workings of trust. It’s a nice story although today’s cyn- ics will say it’s all fantasy (see quote below).
