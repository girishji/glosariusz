A solution usually en- tails bringing in more financial resources (i.e. via new investors or lenders such as debtor-in-possession financing) and/or a debt <i>restructuring </i>proposal that somehow makes do with the existing resources but in a reorganised fashion. In the meantime, there is a creditor <i>standstill </i>in which the company either op- erates under existing management (“debtor in possession”) or by a court-ap- pointed trustee<i>. </i>At its termination, the majority of creditors can still chose to exercise their <i>creditor rights </i>to put the company down or accept a rescue plan</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">which may well involve some debt forgiveness. Dissenting creditors might be forced to go along if the court views them as being unreasonable (see <i>cram down</i>). Chapter 11, in contrast to creditor controlled administration<i>, </i>tempers the immediate exercise of creditor rights for the sake of both <i>debtor rights </i>and an orderly turnaround<i>. </i>In its absence, fixing a company’s financial problems can be chaotic, adversarial and wasteful (by failing to preserve what has recoverable value).
