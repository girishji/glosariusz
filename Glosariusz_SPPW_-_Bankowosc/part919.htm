Given the size of the fund and its counterparties, it was deemed <i>too big to fail </i>and was rescued by a US Treasury-lead consortium of major Wall Street banks. The significance of the event was twofold. Quantitative techniques endured some humbling reputational damage (LTCM was run using highly sophisticated <i>proprietary trading </i>techniques developed by mathematicians, including two Nobel laureates). LTCM business model of capturing small, incremental <i>arbitrage </i>trading profits necessitated high leverage to earn attractive returns. While the model suggested that volatility was understood and tolerable, an unexpected long tail event quickly wiped out LTCM’s modest capital cushion (see quote below). The other impact was more indirect and subtle. Increased market volatility led more investors to embrace credit derivatives creating one of the contributing factors to the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 ten years later.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4038.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The increased skill in measuring risk and modelling risk led to neglect of uncertainty at LTCM, and the result is you could use a lot more leverage than you should if you reco- gnise uncertainty.
