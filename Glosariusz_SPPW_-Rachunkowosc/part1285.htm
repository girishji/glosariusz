Another unsung role is as the informal representatives and advocates of the public accountancy profession. Prior to 2002, the Big Four were the Big Five, including Arthur Andersen. They saw themselves multi-disciplinary practices reflecting their broader range of services that includes audit, management consulting, tax, corporate finance and legal. However, accounting scandals and regulatory reform has radically altered their modus ope- randi. In the aftermath, there are two public concerns about the Big Four. One is the lack of engagement choice. According to a study in the UK, a third of the chairmen of FTSE 350 audit committees felt their companies did not have a sufficient choice of an auditor (”Financial Times”, April 12, 2006). A second is a variation of the <span class="s27">too big to fail doctrine</span>: the morale hazard that might arise from over-dependency on the Big Four. Since the capital markets would be so unsettled by any more Andersen-like departures, accounting regulators might be reluctant to be tough.

They were originally very common in early Anglo-Saxon trade and banking. In Europe, bills of exchange are still common in Greece, Italy and Spain but less so in economies where more convenient and less expensive indirect bank financ- ing in available. A supplier of goods or services on credit “presents” the bill to a buyer who</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in turns “accepts” it for future payment (say, in 30–60 day’s time). In this fashion, the bill becomes evidence of indebtedness and is not open to dispute (unless fraud can be proved). A bill of exchange can be held to maturity or “discounted” to a third party and thereby be immediately converted into cash. If there is a market for the bill, the discounter can “redis- count” the bill and also receive cash. The process can continue amongst various willing parties with the last owner of the bill being a “holder in due course”. The holder then col- lects payment from buyer (or “maker” of the bill). In the event of non-payment and default, the holder can claim against any previous “endorser” (i.e. the party who rediscounted and guaranteed payment). When bills of exchange are discounted, some accounting complica- tions arise. A discount “without recourse” (i.e. the holder cannot come back to the origi- nal beneficiary) can be treated as a straightforward sale. A discount “with recourse” is less clear-cut. It could be a sale with disclosure of a contingent off-balance sheet liability. Or, the substance of the transaction might be considered to be a loan with the promissory note as collateral and treated accordingly.
