It today’s post-crisis world, struggling for sustainable growth formulae, it might be the issue. Economies committed to <i>liberalisation </i>tend to step aside to let financial markets operate as they please, subject to “light touch” prudential regulations designed to protect the innocent and promote stability. Since governments have a legitimate role in the prudential <i>regulation </i>of financial markets and in setting macro-economic policies, the is- sue is one of degree. Repression is an unhealthy or unnatural intervention at the expense of the public’s overall, long term welfare. It is characterised by various measures all of which tend to fetter the spontaneous working of markets operat- ing through the price mechanism and striving to maximise financial yields:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">limitations on domestic financial sector competition</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">excessively high central bank reserve requirements on deposit-taking banks</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">forced investment in government securities by banks or pension funds</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">restrictions on the entry of foreign competitors</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">regulated interest rates unrelated to the demand and supply of capital</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">nationalising banks or keeping them government owned</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s23">◆ </span>using <i>moral suasion </i>to encourage lending to pet projects</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">encouraging negative real interest rates due to inflation</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">caps on banks’ lending rates to make low yield government debt</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">more attractive</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">inflation to create negative real interest rates and a defacto tax on savers.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">The long-term consequences of financial repression are typically negative and ac- cumulate to a drag on economic performance:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">bloated government sectors unconstrained by financing</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s23">◆ </span>shallow <i>financial depth </i>and low savings rates</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">inefficient, bureaucratic and timid banks due to a lack of healthy competitive</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">pressures</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">mispricing of risk and an inefficient allocation of credit</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">investment programmes which favour grandiose size at the expense</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of profitability</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">weak enforcement of market discipline against borrowers of questionable</span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">viability</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">short term investment horizons.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">“Repression” is a loaded word. One person’s repression is another’s “government policy”. Over-zealous <i>re-regulation</i>, responding to a financial crisis, may uncon- sciously tread upon the realm of repression. Authorities can wrap themselves in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="119" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3665.png"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">936 <span class="s28">Financial Repression</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3666.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">the flag of “prudence” to justify excessive intervention, especially when bankers are politically unpopular. In centrally planned economies, it was consistent with the ideology of disallowing any market freedoms. With the fall of communism, central planning is gone. But old attitudes linger on amongst the legacy systems of left-wing parties and the administrative apprentice. In emerging or transi- tional markets, repression is openly defended as a temporary “transitional” stage on the road to mature development. Policy makers argue that mild repression is necessary to shield their untested, and therefore, fragile banking sectors from the unforgiving forces of the global capital market. The goal is to keep international financial capital (more stable foreign direct investment is another story) out of an emerging economy in order to avoid inflationary pressures, asset bubbles and sudden capital flights. China, for example, uses extensive financial repression in the name of consciously managing its economic development. Its export-driven growth, needed to boost employment in order to avoid social unrest, is spurred on by an under-valued currency. Another hidden, and perhaps less legitimate, use of financial repression is by developed economies to eliminate an overhang of public debt. This is accomplished by a stealth strategy of inflation and negative interest rates in a captive domestic market. Over time this will erode debt-to-GDP levels. In effect, it is a tax on private sector savings. In the high debt period after the cost of World War II, this form of repression, albeit not acknowledged by name, was used by many economies, including the USA and the UK. Given today’s high debt levels after the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009, many governments might be tempted to resort to the strategy (see quote below) versus the less attractive</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3667.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Financial repression <span class="s12">contributed to rapid debt reduction fol- lowing World War II.
