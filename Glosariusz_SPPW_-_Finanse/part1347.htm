Convertibles are typically exercised at the holder’s option. However, they may be also structured to be convertible at the issuer’s option (with investor’s requiring a compensating yield for the extra risk of being forced into shares). “Mandatory convertibles” automatically turn into shares at a spe- cific future date. Compared to the rest of the bond market, the size of the con- vertible market is relatively limited.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3505">Core Business </a><a href="part617.htm#bookmark1587" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Podstawowa działalność firmy </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">The basic, fundamental </span><span class="p">activity of an enterprise before diversification or ancillary services. The impor- tance of identifying a core business is in recognising which activity has com- petitive advantage – hence the notion of “core competency” – and which there- fore deserves strategic emphasis. While a core business can be elusive, exploiting it can be a superior, rare and valuable activity. A focus on what really counts allows peripheral activities to be sold, jettisoned, outsourced or undertaken as a strategic alliance with someone else. Alternatively, in more desperate circum- stances, a core business is the activity the enterprise can fall back on or retreat to in the event of a downsizing or restructuring. Core business may change with time. In the case of banks, their traditional business of intermediating – gather- ing up low interest deposits and lending to businesses – is under pressure from</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="242" alt="image" src="Image_4807.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concentration</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concentration</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concentration</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">competition from other <i>financial institutions</i>, <i>capital markets </i>and even indus- trial concerns (e.g. finance companies).
