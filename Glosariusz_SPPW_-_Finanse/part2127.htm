For example, shares trading at, say, €150 each would require a minimum investment of €15,000 for a 100-share <i>board lot</i>. This might be too much for many retail investors. A significantly lower price would draw out demand for the shares and boost price. Stock splits are also taken as a <i>signal </i>that the company’s prospects are favourable, a sentiment that will also tend to increase share value.
