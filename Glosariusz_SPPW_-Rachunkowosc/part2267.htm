Specific examples include real estate property taxes, sometimes called “municipal taxes”, and inheritance tax. It can also be associated with a tax on the net asset holdings of <i>high net worth individuals</i>. Economists in free market economies generally frown upon any tax on wealth. First, if income is already taxed, a wealth tax becomes a form of <i>double taxation </i>if the wealth has been accumulated after-tax. Second,</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">it creates disincentives for wealth creation, savings and entrepreneurship. Finally, it chal- lenges property rights by biting into a person’s private possessions. That said, wealth tax can be politically popular in societies with large inequities, inherited privilege and social envy, perhaps because cynicism about the efficacy of an economic system. As well, since the majority of wealth is often concentrated, substantial amounts of revenue can be raised from comparatively few people, allowing the tax burden on the majority of the population to be kept down. Finally, a wealth tax can be tempting simply because it is easy to assess and collect a stock, as opposed to an income flow over time. In this way, <i>vertical equity </i>(so that people of similar means pay the same and those with more pay more) can be achieved in ways that income taxes cannot. That said, the wealthiest people are often the most skilled at <i>tax avoidance</i><a href="http://www.OECD.org/" class="s24" target="_blank">, not the least because they can afford good tax accountants. Weighing in all these factors, wealth tax is relatively rare. Thus, on aver- age across the OECD, wealth taxes account for less than 2% of total tax revenue (</a><a href="http://www.OECD.org/" class="s135" target="_blank">www. </a><span style=" color: #1922FB;">OECD.org</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:71.7591pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:24pt"><td style="width:55pt" bgcolor="#000000"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:256pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:2pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">vs. poor</p></td></tr><tr style="height:56pt"><td style="width:311pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt" colspan="2"><p class="s108" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I’ve been rich and I’ve been poor.

A “weighted average” method (i.e. volumes multiplied by their price and then averaged) is used to do this. This is contrary to the way actual costs are incurred (most businesses try to hold “fresh” inventory by selling their oldest inventory first). However, it does reflect the commercial reality that <i>fungible </i>inventory is pooled. It also has merit as a compromise between the competing <i>FIFO </i>and <i>LIFO </i>methods. If prices are constant, all methods will produce the same results. It is when prices are changing that there is an impact on reported financial results. To see the significance of the WAC assumption, we can compare the accounting (simplified by having equal weights in each period) with the different methods:</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2266.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2268.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
