While speculative pockets of capital might well exist, since banks have large capital needs, they need to tap the depth of more conventional, and cau- tious, institutional markets. Moreover, the spectre of the nationalisation or part nationalisation of <i>too-big-to-fail </i>banks – which has already occurred in Ireland and the UK – means that even bold investors are wary. Regulators are under no delusions. Based on <i>stress tests </i>and tighter capital requirements, EU regulators are looking for €100+ billion in new bank capital, very little of which will likely come from new shareholder subscriptions (see graph above). When even cau- tious bankers and regulators have doubts about the investment appeal of banks, their shares are truly “uninvestable”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4952.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Uninvestable <span class="s12">is just about the worst word in a sharehold- ers’ vocabulary.

They may also be referred to as “full service” banks or “financial super-markets”. While providing debt or equity are different offers, this is done primarily for the sake of capturing operating synergies, to provide better service (e.g. “one stop” shopping) or diversification.

Other justifications include the desire to limit the size and power of banks generally, fears over conflicts of interest (e.g. rescuing weak borrowers to save bad loans), regulatory complexity and insider trading (lenders know more than the public). In looking at the merits of combining a commercial and investment banking, we can see the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:85.1644pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:15pt"><td style="width:312pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt" colspan="2" bgcolor="#7C7B7B"><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Universal Banking Scorecard</p></td></tr><tr style="height:13pt"><td style="width:152pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 64pt;padding-right: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Pros</p></td><td style="width:160pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;padding-right: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Cons</p></td></tr><tr style="height:57pt"><td style="width:152pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s73" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="s30">Tighter client relationships by being able to offer underwriting of both debt and equity; clients can enjoy “one stop” service from the same institution which knows them well</span></p></td><td style="width:160pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s73" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="s30">Power concentration to the extent that investment banking involves large industrial holdings as market makers and/or exercising supervisory control as shareholders</span></p></td></tr><tr style="height:37pt"><td style="width:152pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s30" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;padding-right: 12pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><span class="s73">◆ </span>Economies of scope, especially since <i>disintermediation </i>is tending to lessen the traditional lending role</p></td><td style="width:160pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s73" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;padding-right: 11pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="s30">Potential conflicts of interest between trading and lending activities due to access to insider information</span></p></td></tr><tr style="height:38pt"><td style="width:152pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s73" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;padding-right: 11pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">◆ <span class="s30">Diversification of earnings streams between distinctive activities making the universal bank more stable</span></p></td><td style="width:160pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s30" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;"><span class="s73">◆ </span>Divisive corporate culture between the transaction-oriented <i>investment banker </i>and the relationship-oriented <i>commercial banker</i></p></td></tr></table><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Much of the distinction between a commercial and investment bank was tradi- tionally <i>regulatory</i>. In the case of commercial banks, the trend towards <i>securitisa- tion </i>is tending the blur the line between intermediation and capital market par- ticipation. Thus, with deregulation, there was a trend towards universal banking especially after the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009 weakened so many independent investment banks pushing them into the arms of others. Any remaining barri- ers to universal banking are either market-inspired or by design. In this regard, many banks may choose to operate separately simply to focus on a single core competency. Combinations which approach a universal bank also can be ac- complished by separate banks operating under the umbrella of a bank holding company (see quote below). Working against fully integrating commercial and investment banking activities are <i>post-credit crisis responses</i>. For example, the <i>Volcker Rule </i>and UK banking reforms aim at <i>ring-fencing </i>utility-type banking operations protected by the public’s safety net. The relatively more risky trading activities on the investment side are isolated in order to invoke the <i>right to fail doctrine</i>. See also <i>bancassurance </i>for how banking is combined with insurance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="112" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4955.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1135.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1137.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
