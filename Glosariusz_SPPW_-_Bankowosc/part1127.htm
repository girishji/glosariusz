By back- stopping demand in the secondary market, TARP was designed to be a catalyst to return credit markets to normalcy. Sellers’ balance sheets would suffer less impairment losses if a minimum price floor for questionable assets could be established. With their capital adequacy less threatened by write-down losses, banks would hopefully begin the lending needed to restore healthier economic activity. TARP was never meant to be a subsidy program. By purchasing assets at their negotiated fair value, sellers might well suffer a loss. But ultimately both the government and banks would hopefully eventually earn gains as excessively discounted assets were sold back at their true value later on. In order to avoid the abuse of <i>moral hazard</i>, banks accessing TARP support had to issue equity warrants to the US government allowing the public to profit at the private share- holder’s expense once bank share prices recovered. While TARP was a an unu- sual market-oriented intervention justified by desperate times, it is not without its controversy. If purchased assets proved to be worth less than their intrinsic value, the American taxpayer would have been saddled with huge losses. An- other concern at the time was whether its intended objectives would be met. Nervous banks could have hoarded the extra liquidity provided by TARP in- stead of ramping up loans to an economy in recession. On a deeper ideological level, some question the merits of any public intervention in free market econo- mies. In the end, TARP’s best justification was its expediency. It was a breathing space to buy time to fix the long-standing flaws in US financial system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4918.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The legislative challenge [of regulatory reform] has three parts: (1) to acknowledge after decades of steady deregula- tion that unchecked “faith in the marketplace” is no longer warranted; (2) to replace said faith with a modern system of rules and relations that guarantees there will be no more catastrophic meltdowns; and (3) to somehow accomplish No 2 without sucking all the creativity and imagination out of the American financial services industry.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excerpted from the “Fortune” (Europe), 13 April 2009, p. 51</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The legislative challenge [of regulatory reform] has three parts: (1) to acknowledge after decades of steady deregula- tion that unchecked “faith in the marketplace” is no longer warranted; (2) to replace said faith with a modern system of rules and relations that guarantees there will be no more catastrophic meltdowns; and (3) to somehow accomplish No 2 without sucking all the creativity and imagination out of the American financial services industry.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excerpted from the “Fortune” (Europe), 13 April 2009, p. 51</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The legislative challenge [of regulatory reform] has three parts: (1) to acknowledge after decades of steady deregula- tion that unchecked “faith in the marketplace” is no longer warranted; (2) to replace said faith with a modern system of rules and relations that guarantees there will be no more catastrophic meltdowns; and (3) to somehow accomplish No 2 without sucking all the creativity and imagination out of the American financial services industry.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excerpted from the “Fortune” (Europe), 13 April 2009, p. 51</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1126.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1128.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
