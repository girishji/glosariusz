They can be calcu- lated to suit the analyst’s own needs. Ratios must be interpreted and put into context, either by “comparative” or “trend” analysis. Comparative analysis re- quires a <i>benchmark </i>standard to compare against. For example, a <i>working capital </i>ratio of “1.3” is far more significant if we know that enterprises in the same in- dustry typically have ratios of, say, “1.8”. Another use of financial ratios is to examine trends over time to get an idea of where the company might be going. A caveat with ratios is that they are only as good as the underlying inputs or values. For instance, if seasonality affects the accounts, care will have to be taken in interpreting the resulting ratios. Or, if <i>assets </i>are overvalued, the resulting ratio will be distorted. Summarising, ratios are a convenient expedient – not insight. In the words of Donaldson, they are “a shorthand for a shorthand”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The operating ratios are of great value as measures of efficiency but they are only measures and not efficiency itself… Management remains a matter of judgement, of knowledge of products and processes and of understanding and skill in dealing with people.
