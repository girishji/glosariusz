The net effect of balance sheet adjustments is to increase the equity account to reflect the bal- ance sheet’s increased values, net of constant liabilities. In the short term, the existence of both monetary assets and liabilities has no immediate effect on equity. However, over time, the enterprise will enjoy a gain from these liabilities since it will make con- tractual payments for both interest and principal in a “cheaper” currency. The CVA income statement is considerably more complex. Like any income statement, it must reconcile opening and closing equity. There are two distinct approaches to doing this. An American variant allows the nominal gains in tangible assets to be included in net profit. An UK variant, in contrast, excludes such asset gains and is a more rigorous test of capital maintenance. Both variants reduce the HCA accounting net profit based on the common agreement that inflation erodes profitability. CVA is complex and lacks a commonly agreed consensus on how it should be calculated. It tends to be confined to <i>footnote disclosure. </i>As inflation has subsided in most industrialised countries, it is no longer commonly employed.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3630"><span class="s22">Customer Advances </span></a><a href="part1031.htm#bookmark2541" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Zaliczki otrzymane na poczet dostaw </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="s26">Funds received </span>from customers in advance of the receipt of goods or services. The <i>matching </i>principle treats such money as unearned income that should be recognised as income over the future life of the <i>contract</i>. Examples: magazine subscription payments or revenues from the sale of syndication rights for films. Customer advances are not debt as they do not require a future cash payment (unless there are refund privileges). Rather, they will be</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">satisfied by the future delivery of goods or services. They are indicators of a firm’s future sales rather than a cash outflow. Financial analysts interested in a <i>market value </i>balance sheet may adjust liabilities accordingly.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark3631">Customer Profitability Analysis </a><a href="part44.htm#bookmark105" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part44.htm#bookmark105" class="s25">Analiza rentowności według klientów</a><span class="s39"> </span><span class="s23">•</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Management accounting <span class="p">information that identifies how much </span>profit <span class="p">is generated</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">per customer or class of customers. The analysis needs to focus on both <i>revenues </i>and <i>expenses</i>. The greatest challenge is usually in identifying costs. Arbitrary allocations are less useful than <i>activity based costing </i>which tries to pinpoint how much effort is required to sell or provide services to a customer. Customer profitability analysis in turn becomes very useful by telling which customers are worth pursuing and which should be avoided. In the case of low profitability customers, sellers can either try to modify their buying behaviour, get them to accept higher prices or simply encourage them to go elsewhere.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark3632">Cut-off (Period End) </a><a href="part751.htm#bookmark1850" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part751.htm#bookmark1850" class="s25">Rozdzielenie pozycji należących do różnych okresów</a><span class="s39"> </span><span class="s23">•</span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The date that defines the end of an <i>accounting period</i>.

One way to <i>window dress </i>is to shift trans- actions back and forth over the cut-off. As examples, in the case of <i>revenue recognition</i>, income can be boosted through the manipulation of the cut-off by these manoeuvres (examples c/o “Cases from the SEC Files” by Cullinan and Wright, 2003, pp. 62–63):</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1471.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1473.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
