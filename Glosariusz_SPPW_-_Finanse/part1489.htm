Indeed, straight salary is often a very modest portion of total compensation (see chart p. 203). Often negotiated contractual arrangements result in some perverse outcomes. For example, to attract executive talent to a turnaround situation, a premium with guarantees in the event of failure. The execs then walk away with seemingly grotesque pay in the face of mess everywhere else.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3888"><span class="s21">Executive Stock Options </span></a><a href="part560.htm#bookmark1441" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Opcje menedżerskie dla zarządu </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">Compensa- </span>tion schemes whereby top <i>management </i>are given <i>options </i>to buy their compa- nies’ <i>shares </i>in the future at a favourable price. Options are an attempt to deal with the <i>agency problem</i>. Managers are incentivised to put <i>shareholder </i>interests first when they have a tangible stake in shareholder success. Options also com- pensate management in a seemingly “costless” fashion. Instead of the burden of a direct payroll expense, beneficiaries reap a <i>capital gain </i>in the <i>stock market</i>. As well, the options foster “loyalty”, or at least lower staff turnover, if there is a minimum holding period prior to exercising them. However, executive stock options have associated costs. They cause share <i>dilution</i>. In the USA, where more than 10% of outstanding shares have been allocated to such options (“Fi-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">nancial Times”, August 21, 1999), this imposes a significant offset to sharehold- er wealth. Easy pay-offs in a rising stock market deliver windfall gains inde- pendent of any particular managerial excellence. This may actually result in a disincentive effect (“we’re looking good – why try harder?”) and can generate social envy amongst other staff. Finally, their complex and hidden nature makes it difficult to quantify their true cost. At first, most <i>accounting standards </i>at best disclosed the options in (often dauntingly complex) <i>notes</i>. There was reluctance, especially in the USA, to try to quantify the cost and deduct it from reported net profit for fear of discouraging the work ethic especially in entrepreneurial start- ups. However, by 2005, the economic expense of stock options was incorporat- ed into the financial reporting model in most regimes.
