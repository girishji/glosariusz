Originally intended to be a certificate representing the value of confiscated church properties they soon proliferated as the government, lacking a tax base, was desperate for revenue. The unchecked issuance caused massive hyperinflation and social unrest, turmoil that was only solved in 1803 when Napoleon issued the franc.

In plain English it could be called “commercial ignorance”. Asymmetric information is seen as particularly relevant to the loan contract: it is difficult for lenders, as outsiders, to truly understand a business and its risks as well as its owners do. So much so that Keynes called it ‘lender’s risk’ (see below). Since loans must repay into an uncertain future, lenders must <i>know the borrower </i>in order to gauge credit risk. Large publicly traded firms with audited financial reporting and a credit rating pose less of a problem. It is the <i>SME </i>market segment where the asymmetric information problem is the greatest. Absent publicly available</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">financial information (e.g. financial statements, share prices, credit ratings etc.) lenders are ‘in the dark’. Moreover, because of the relatively modest size of loans, there are commercial limits to the amount of information gathering and <i>due diligence </i>which can be carried out. This is not all bad news for banks. Because of their relationship knowledge from carrying deposit accounts, commercial banks that are well positioned enjoy a protected niche in <i>small business lending</i>. Asymmetric information is seen as one justification for secured lending as a means to offset the inherently uncertainty of a business by providing a <i>second way out. </i>It also accounts for a <i>risk premium </i>on interest rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="139" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2649.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part612.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part614.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
