They are deferred compensation that should be recognised as expenses and accrued as liabilities (see <i>retirement benefit obliga- tions</i>) as employees earn the right to the future payouts while they are working. Plans can either be <i>funded vs</i>. <i>unfunded</i>, depending upon the payer’s choice or regulations. Plans can also payout according to <i>defined contribution </i>or <i>defined benefit </i>arrangements. Since defined contribution plans involve no guarantee of a future payout, the accrued expense equals fixed amounts. However, in the case of defined benefit plans, there are two major sources of complexity and, in turn, <i>accounting judgement</i>. First, the ultimate payouts to retirees will be a function of future salary levels, life expectancy and (in the case of funded pensions) investment yields on the pension fund. Second, even if future payouts are deter- mined, how should they be accrued over the employee’s working life? In the case of funded defined benefit plans there are also two distinct complications: determining the pension expense for future payouts and the pension liability. The later is a function of pension liabilities net of amounts accruing in the designated investment fund. This can result in under-funded or over-funded pensions and, in some countries (e.g. USA), the recognition of <i>pension income (corporate)</i>.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4893">Post (Subsequent) Balance Sheet Event </a><a href="part1073.htm#bookmark2645" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Zdarzenie po dacie bilansu </span><span class="s23">•</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Accounting events <span class="p">that occur between the end of the </span>accounting period <span class="p">(i.e. when the</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">books <span class="p">are closed) and the public issuance of </span>financial statements<span class="p">.
