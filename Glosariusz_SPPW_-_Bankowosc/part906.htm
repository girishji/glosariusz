When combined with a deposit current account, a line of credit or overdraft facility (British terminology) is a convenient and economical way to manage liquidity<i>. Deposits </i>serve to reduce the outstanding loan while withdraw- als increase it. Borrowers like such a financial product because of its convenience (usually there are no restrictions on purpose), flexibility and reduced borrow- ing cost (interest accruing only on outstanding amounts). Since a line of credit’s utilisation can go up or down, the lender does not have the comfort of seeing a <i>term loan’s </i>consistent repayment. Indeed, to the extent that interest is paid by the line of credit itself, even capitalised interest can go unpaid. Therefore lines of credit should be granted based on the creditworthiness of borrower versus <i>expo-</i></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">sure <span class="p">(i.e. assuming a fully drawn line).
