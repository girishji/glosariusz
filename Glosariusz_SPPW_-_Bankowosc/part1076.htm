Other worthwhile candidates for site visits are <i>small and medium enterprises </i>who often do not offer the bank formal financial reporting information. Seeing the concrete reality of a busi- ness’s operations brings it ‘to life’ the way numbers on a page cannot. Site visits are also a good way to develop customer relations and loyalty (most people like the attention and are proud of their businesses), not to mention providing a refreshing break from the office routine. Finally, site visits are a common way to call on prospects to generate new business. In the case of consumer credit, the <i>home collected credit </i>model is founded on the merits of physical contact with borrowers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4719.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Maintain continuous touch with the borrower.
