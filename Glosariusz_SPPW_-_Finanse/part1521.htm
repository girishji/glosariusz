Such disclosure is primarily via statutory <i>financial reporting </i>(which is a legal minimum) but is also supplemented by other forms of communication (e.g. press releases, analysts meetings, guidance). While fi- nancial disclosure has a cost (see <i>go private</i>), it can also create value. The more information investors can analyze, the greater their confidence in their ability to understand a business will be and thereby they will bid up the price of its shares.
