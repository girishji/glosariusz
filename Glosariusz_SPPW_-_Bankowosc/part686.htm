Chapter 11 has been especially useful in coping with sudden and unmanageable threats to a going concern. For example, in 1982, Johns-Mansville, a large and viable US corporation with $2.2 billion in sales, suddenly faced 16,000 lawsuits from ‘out of the blue’ asbestos litigation. It used Chapter 11 to achieve an orderly payout of settlements. Many companies, faced with unreasonable threats from ‘ambulance chasing’ litigation, would fol- low suit (ref: <i>The $200 Billion Miscarriage of Justice </i>in the “Fortune Magazine”, 4/3/02, pp. 73–81).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3009.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The purpose is, in theory at least, to give the debtor time to develop a rescue plan; creditors can also propose a plan...

For practical purposes, (say, small amounts of money to people of undoubted strength), somebody might safely and sensibly make a character loan. So parents will lend money to their children. Banks are different. Mak- ing a character loan can be akin to rationalising a weak lending proposition. That said, it is judiciously done all the time, typically with individuals where the only real issue is <i>won’t pay versus can’t pay</i>. In the case of bank credit for busi- nesses, all loans should have a significant element of character assessment in them since “willingness to repay” is a precondition to “ability to repay” (albeit a necessary but not sufficient one). In business loans, “character” encompasses not only moral integrity but commitment, hard work, commercial common sense and management skills. These can be tough to gauge (see quote below).
