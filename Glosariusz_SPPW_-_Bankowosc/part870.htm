Since cheques can always be returned due to <i>non sufficient funds </i>(a.k.a. ‘bounced’ in slang), the acceptor is exposed to settlement risk. In the meantime, the amounts on hold are shown as credited to the account in the customer’s statement. Another type of hold is an uncleared item on a pre-authorised credit card or debt card account. For example, a merchant might ‘telephone in’ a pre-authorised approval for a large purchase. If the customer has sufficient room on their line or credit or funds on</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">account, the amount will be set aside for the pending transaction. In the mean- time, an “available balance” will be indicated to show how much money can be withdrawn going forward. Holds will typically be automatically removed in the 1–2 days it takes for items to clear through payment systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2438"><span class="s22">Home Collected Credit </span></a><a href="part188.htm#bookmark550" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro Bold&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Kredyt udzielany w domu </span>– Small, unsecured con- sumer loans which are extended and collected by independent agents visiting the <i>borrower’s </i>premises. Home collected credit is a financial service especially popular in Britain where low-income consumers often cannot qualify for credit from the “high street” <i>banks</i>. In 1880, Sir Joshua Waddilove, a Victorian phi- lanthropist, founded Provident Financial to assist working class people near Bradford in northern England to gain access to credit. Today, the <i>sub-prime lender </i>(USA vernacular) is one of UK’s leading providers of home collected credit. The simplicity and convenience of home collected credit, with its all-in credit charge, the discipline of making small but regular payments and absence of security, is appealing to many consumers who are locked out of the bank-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">ing system. The close interpersonal relationship that often develops between a borrower and an agent (both of whom are often females) also makes borrow- ing less intimidating (see <i>bankers’ image</i>) although it might compromise “arm’s length” impartiality. The inherent <i>credit risk </i>from such lending is compensated by tight monitoring and the small size (say, £50–250) of each loan. <i>Interest rates </i>must typically be relatively high to compensate for the agent’s fee, the costs of home visits and loan losses. Alas, there is the ever-present vulnerability to abuse from credit traps and “tricks and traps” pricing. While lending companies try to distance themselves from ‘rogue’ agents, there is often complicity at work. That said, home collected credit is a valuable service to those on the margins of society who otherwise would be denied access to loans. This gives it a social legitimacy even in the face of the lingering potential for abuse. Contrast to <i>loan sharking </i>and compare to credit cards, the preferred vehicle for banks to access this market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="288" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3810.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part869.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part871.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
