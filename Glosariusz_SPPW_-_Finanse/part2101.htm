However, a refusal to buy another’s holding triggers an obligation to sell holdings to the offering party at the very same specified price. Thus a <i>call </i>is created (i.e. a right to buy). In effect, if the price is deemed too high, it stands to reason that a refusing party should be willing to sell. Such a mechanism prevents the holders, who stay in the business, from taking advan- tage of the party that wants to leave. At the same time, it prevents a holder from being coerced to buy out an exiting party at an unreasonable level. In effect, a shotgun clause creates an internal market for an investment that has no external market. The reference to a shotgun comes from the double-barrelled operation: fire one shot followed by another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="332" alt="image" src="Image_7493.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Something to Hide</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Something to Hide</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Something to Hide</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5484"><span class="s21">Side Deal </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part288.htm#bookmark737" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Interes na boku </span><span class="s48">(żargon) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">Any commercial agree- </span>ment that is an adjunct to another, main agreement or the market in general.

Share prices will then rise via the <i>dividend growth model</i>. Alternatively, if prospects are excep- tionally attractive, a firm might signal this to the market by declaring less divi- dends. Much of finance theory says that dividends should not matter (which rebutts signalling). Unless there are tax implications, shareholders could argu- ably be indifferent between receiving cash dividends or, if those funds are re- tained in the business and re-invested, enjoying <i>capital gains </i>through higher share prices (assuming prices reflect re-invested dividends kept inside the firm). Moreover, companies can raise fresh capital to replace what has been paid out to existing shareholders. However, those investors who prefer the regular in- come of a dividend stream compared to periodically selling shares could read dividends as a signal and price shares accordingly. There is a debate whether dividend policy actually signals anything when <i>efficient markets </i>are supposed to know the true value of firms regardless of management’s efforts to communicate anything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="407" height="356" alt="image" src="Image_7495.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="78" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7496.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Agitated</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Agitated</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Agitated</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2100.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2102.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
