Finally, since banks are regulated already, they are akin to “utility” operations with natural monopolies that are best left to expand but kept under the eye of the public authorities (see <i>utility banking</i>). The flaws in this institu- tional structure are twofold. Competition can be suppressed. Globalisation that opens markets to outsiders and disintermediation driven by capital markets is thus useful to keep banks ‘on their toes’. Additionally, even a few players can be fiercely competitive amongst one another. The other problem is moral hazard from the <i>too big to fail doctrine</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2004"><span class="s22">Concentration Risk (Loan) </span></a><a href="part429.htm#bookmark1348" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Ryzyko koncentracji kredytów </span><b>– </b>The hazards of having a large loan exposure to one borrower or connected group of borrow- ers (either by industry or region) within a loan portfolio. Concentration nulli- fies the safety of <i>diversification: </i>an unexpected loss can be so large that it will have a noticeable impact on a bank’s profitability and capital. Concentration also leaves a bank vulnerable to dealing with problems impartially and expedi- ently. Hence the classic saying: “Owe the bank a million and it owns you; owe the bank a billion and you own it”. For this reason, concentration limits (typi- cally relating maximum exposure to a share, say 10% to 20%, of bank capital) are usually created by prudent bank management and bank regulators.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3125.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It may be remarked, that it is generally bad policy in a bank to make a very large permanent advance to any <b>one cus- tomer</b>.
