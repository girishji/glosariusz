In most banks, this is describes as the consumer/retail and SME customer segments. This con- trasts to transactional clients who are driven by impersonal market considera- tions, especially pricing. This is more typical of the corporate or institutional customer segment. If a customer base can be protected from competitor intru- sions (see <i>barriers to selling</i>), a bank can be said to enjoy a franchise. A good customer base is important for two reasons: i) as a source of stable, core deposits and ii) an opportunity to cross sell other products which builds profitability and cements relationships even further. As banks become under increasing com-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">petitive pressure from disintermediation and deregulation, capturing, retaining and building a stable customer base is the key to their performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3055.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Perhaps I might be allowed to digress and explain why one who employs a bank is referred to as a <b>‘customer’ and not a ‘client’ </b>as is the case when employing a solicitor or ac- countant, for instance.

Traditionally, banks were not particularly client service oriented when it came to credit because they enjoyed a protected market position and due to a fear that prudence, based on impar- tial indifference, would be compromised.
