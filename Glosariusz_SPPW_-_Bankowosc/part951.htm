In the background is an explicit or implicit threat to exercise more authority if needed. Its slang description is “jawboning” i.e. talking (see the <i>Compendium of Finance</i>). Moral suasion is akin to ‘saving your powder’ for the real fight i.e. it is an effort to only exercise authority when needed. It can be an effective policy tool if rational economic agents can be persuaded that it is in their long-term best interests to voluntarily comply with in- tended government policies. We might call this “enlightened, collectively respon- sible self-interest”. Normally, competitive pressures limit such motives especially when they conflict with profit-maximisation, even in the short run. However, in the case of commercial banks, moral suasion can be more effective. Banks have</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="413" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4163.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">a heightened sense of a fiduciary duty, they tend to be more sensitive to reputa- tion risk and, most of all, they are dependent on the goodwill of the central bank in its capacity as a <i>lender of last resort</i>. Whether, and how, moral suasion is used can depend upon the degree of influence of monetary authorities over market players. It has tended to be resorted to more often in the UK (see quote below). Moral suasion is often used to supplement, articulate or even justify policy actions by managing the market’s expectations. Thus a central bank would communicate the message: “we really are committed to this target; it would be grand if you complied voluntarily (making it easier for all of us) but count on us to enforce our target if you don’t; you might as well play by our rules”. Word roots: combination of Latin words “moral” = “conduct or character that is right and virtuous” and “suasio” = “to present in a pleasing manner”.
