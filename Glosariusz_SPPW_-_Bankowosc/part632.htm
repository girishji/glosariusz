The words are thus synonyms. A banking charter/licence differs from incorporating a normal business enterprise. The former is a privilege to be granted at the gov- ernment’s discretion (although believers in free banking have suggested other- wise) while the later is a right in most liberal free-market economies. The logic of restricting entry into banking is that the government has a duty and authority to <i>regulate banking </i>in order to protect the interests and welfare of the public. Most governments will issue charters/licences if they are satisfied with the legit- imacy of a new bank’s <i>sponsors </i>and the viability of its business plan. By design, the need to obtain a licence is a hurdle that restricts freedom of entry. The re- sulting suppression of an otherwise healthy bank competition is the price paid for a banking system’s soundness. It confers a valuable franchise right since it is an implicit imprimatur of a bank’s legitimacy.
