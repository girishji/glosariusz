While big firms can enjoy <i>economies of scale </i>they can also suffer from an overstretch that reduces their efficiency. Moreover, the process of growth can be more harmful than increased size itself. For instance, if compa- nies overpay in an acquisition transaction, they will be saddled with higher capital costs and assets with questionable value.

Staff are allowed to buy their em- ployer’s shares at a discount to market prices subject to them being held in a special, segregated fund. The employer contributes the share purchase subsidy and the administration costs of a trust. Eventually, employees qualify (either by job performance or by tenure) to receive the shares. In the meantime, so long as the shares remain in the fund, the government allows both the benefit and any income from the shares to be non-taxable. ESOPs are not to be confused with </span><span class="s25">share-based compensation </span><span class="p">plans. Rather, they are designed to encourage long- term saving and to give staff a stake in the enterprise, thereby encouraging </span><span class="s25">goal</span><a name="bookmark3825">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">congruence<span class="p">.

However, the fact that either party can break it on short notice makes employment for most of us a “one step at a time” prop- osition. However, in the case of top executive recruited from outside (free agents vs. loyal staff who have worked their way up the ladder) employment contracts are often (especially in the USA) necessary to attract top talent, more so if the business badly needs strong leadership. The focus on these contracts will be on rewarding successful performance (i.e. bonus formula) and protection against a subsequent parting of the ways (i.e. severance package). While such contracts are entirely legitimate, they must be negotiated carefully to avoid <i>deal heat</i>. This makes them a <i>corporate governance </i>issue. In the face of high profile payouts (in</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">the USA, Messrs Orvitz of Walt Disney, Grasso of NYSE and Nardelli of Home Depot being the most infamous examples), shareholder rights can be abused. This is especially so if the departing executives have in fact performed poorly in delivering shareholder value creation yet they walk away with millions based on their contract.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="124" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_5178.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Enticement</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Enticement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Enticement</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1466.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1468.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
