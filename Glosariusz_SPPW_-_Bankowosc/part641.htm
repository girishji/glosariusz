The Bank was established in 1694 (only the Bank of Am- sterdam (1609) was earlier) by the promotion scheme of <i>William Paterson</i>. Initially, it was simply a means for</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">English royalty to raise funds for the state treasury. In exchange for holding government debt, the Bank was issued a royal charter with monopoly banking privileges (e.g. <i>banknote </i>issuance and joint stock operation). It grew in size and stature alongside Britain’s economic growth from the industrial revolution and its far-reaching empire. Because of its money power and its connection to the establishment (“Old Corruption”), the Bank was the target of frequent attacks, especially from the free banking interests who accused it of promoting inflation by an over-issuance of <i>paper money</i>. While its privileges were gradually whittled away, it nonetheless grew in stature from its dominant market presence. Despite its commercial instincts, the ‘Old Lady of Threadneedle Street’ was increasingly impelled to act in the national interest. In 1844, when its charter was renewed, it was made the guardian of the gold standard. During financial panics in 1847, 1856 and 1866, its own self-interest and a sense of responsibility obliged it to act, albeit reluctantly at times, as a <i>lender of last resort </i>to its competitors<i>. </i>Be- cause of the <i>City’s </i>pivotal role in overseas finance, the Bank’s influence went far beyond the local money market. In 1873, <i>Walter Bagehot </i>articulated a co- herent rationale for a Bank-lead money policy through holding larger liquidity reserves, more professional management and a conscious use of the rediscount rate (which came to be known as the Bank Rate). The Bank’s reluctance to bold- ly step into such a role left the City in a state of (perhaps healthy) ambivalence until the Bank was nationalised in 1946 (ironically, the year of its founding – 1694 – put in a different order). In the meantime, the clearing banks had to hold larger reserves, perhaps to the detriment of England’s <i>economic progress. </i>The Bank of England was the world’s first central bank. Its evolution into something it was never designed to do, but had to do because of the pressures of expedi- ency, was perhaps an example of the classic English trait of a pragmatic `mud- dling through’.
