Employee benefits may be paid in the period, or in the future, as is the case with <i>post-employment benefits</i>. In modern, post- industrial economies with a large service sector, employee benefits are a Big Number. International accounting rules classify a number of different types of employee benefits, each with distinctive accounting treatment:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">short-term benefits,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">post-employment benefits,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">long-term benefits,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">equity compensation benefits,</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">termination benefits.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For most entities, the most significant category is the short-term benefits. These include wages, salaries, national pension and insurance contributions, paid annual and paren- tal leave (known as “compensated absences”), paid sick leave, non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, and car allowances etc.) and profit sharing or bonus payments payable shortly after the employee provides the service. The accounting for such benefits is generally straightforward: they simply accrue as employees ren- der a service. This is in contrast to post-employment benefits where <span class="s27">actuarial assump- tions </span>may be required to measure the obligation or cost. There are psychic rewards of employment (e.g. professional qualifications, on-the-job training, job satisfaction, pres- tige, social interaction) that are not captured by accounting even though to employees, at least, they may be of considerable value.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3851"><span class="s22">Employee Expense Claims </span></a><a href="part750.htm#bookmark1845" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s39">Roszczenia o zwrot kosztów służbowych </span><span class="s23">• </span><span class="s26">Staff </span>must be re-reimbursed for <i>out-of-pocket </i>expenses incurred on behalf of their employer, say, while travelling on business. This should be a straightforward exercise: “submit receipts for qualifying expenses and we’ll pay you back.” Yet it can often be fraught with abuse, wasted energy and even tension. There may be legitimate dispute over what qualifies to be reim- bursed. Moreover, some staff will inevitably try to abuse the process (see <i>pad expenses</i>). An</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">internal control suggests requiring a sign off by some authority. Tax authorities need to see that a receipt of monies is not taxable income. As one who has both submitted and approved expense claims, your author finds that they are a test of everybody’s sense of fair play.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:71.6169pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:25pt"><td style="width:55pt" bgcolor="#000000"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: right;">i</p></td><td style="width:256pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt"><p class="s107" style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">ng Them Honest</p></td></tr><tr style="height:108pt"><td style="width:311pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:2pt" colspan="2"><p class="s108" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 27pt;padding-right: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Today our companies are willing to spend $100,000 per year for a bean counter whose job it is to make sure that you don’t have</p><p class="s108" style="padding-left: 27pt;padding-right: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$3.55 worth of bacon with your eggs when you’re staying at the approved hotel in Sheboygan.
