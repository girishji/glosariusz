In the USA, for example, the threshold is $250 million, an amount that would be considered large in a smaller market.

This is in presumed contrast to the rest of us: naive, amateur- ish suckers. So you might hear someone saying: “The smart money on Wall Street is beating on an increase in interest rates”. If you believe in the <i>efficient market hypothesis </i>there is no such thing as smart money but rather “lucky mon- ey” or perhaps “thinks they’re smart money” or even “wishes they were smart money”.
