According to a respected measure (ref.: Myers-Briggs Psychological Traits), most bankers will tend to be a:</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">introvert: inward looking at self (vs. Extrovert)</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">sensor: likes hard facts and details (vs. Intuitive)</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">thinker: employ explicitly rational thought processes (vs. Feeler)</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">◆ <span class="p">judger: makes decisions and completes tasks (vs. Perceiver).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">While these traits are the same as a <i>commercial banker’s</i>, the investment banker is typically less cautious and more willing to take risks. The rewards of creativ- ity in the markets may also tend to favour such traits as intuition and feelings. Because of the complexities and risks of the capital markets, investment bankers must be both confident and competent. A more derogatory <i>banker’s image </i>of the investment banker can be as a macho wheeler-dealer:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3886.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There were believed to be – he knew very well what people outside the bank thought, and had known it since his days at Harvard Business School – there were believed to be two kinds of males in American business.

The “transactional” nature of investment banking means you are only as good as your next trade. This pressure makes for a sales culture and a shrewdness to “beat the market” since “in any market, as in any poker game, there is a fool”. This contrasts to the more relaxed “relationship” nature of commercial bank client dealings where, so long as clients stay put and remain solvent, the bank earns money. Another difference is in compensation.
