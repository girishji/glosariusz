The reference arose from the fashion of wearing white brogues on the golf course. Within banking cultures, such footwear could be worn by the socially-sensitive sales and relationship managers (more austere credit people wore black). An embedded connotation is a certain smug and elit- ist soft-headedness versus being hungry and “sharp” (see quote below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_5031.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For much of the Cold War era, most large scale domestic and international underwriting was done by big commer- cial banks, investment banks and insurance companies.

This is in contrast to the <i>retail </i>market composed of individuals, households and small businesses. Because of the complimen- tary gains (especially “core” deposits) from a retail oriented <i>branch </i>network and the inherent attractions of consumer banking (customer loyalty, high margins, broad portfolio diversification etc.), few banks confine themselves exclusively to the wholesale market. A more common approach is a full service banking mod- el in which wholesale banking is part of a portfolio of markets being served (see quote below).
