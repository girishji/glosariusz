A specific amount pay- able will be unconnected to income, asset values or sales. An example would be taxing people based on their status, age, location etc. While such a tax might seem arbitrary, it has several merits. By virtue of being unavoidable, it will not affect people’s behav- iour. This makes it more “neutral” in terms of distorting resource allocation decisions. A</span><a name="bookmark4565">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">lump sum tax is advocated by “head start theorems” that suggest that it is the most effi- cient way to address the unfairness of inequality in a competitive free market economy. Moreover, because each taxpayer knows that whatever they do they will have to pay the same amount, there may be less incentive for <i>tax evasion</i>. Finally, it is also easy to admin- ister since there is no complex process of measuring each person’s income and assets in order to calculate their tax bill. However, because both rich and poor people pay the same amount, there no <i>vertical equity</i>. Thus its basic fairness will be hotly debated despite the intent to reduce inequality.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1854.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1856.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
