However, the process is inherent- ly fraught with difficulties. Going concerns are delicate creatures that typically expire after being wounded. Once the economic value of equity is eliminated by losses, it is the creditors who are left with the greatest vested interest in re- structuring (assuming they don’t want to liquidate the borrower). But it can be especially difficult for far-flung capital market bond holders to initiate. Instead, they just cut their losses and sell their exposure as distressed debt. On the other hand, debtors dealing with the <i>recovery work-out </i>teams of commercial banks may have a better chance of finding solutions by working with their banks. Of- ten this is in concert with private equity funds, merchant banks or investment banks (see quote below) providing both guidance and rescue funds (usually in return for lenders accepting a <i>haircut</i>). For the right discount, bold hedge funds or private equity firms (the US ones often being called “vultures” by Europeans) will buy distressed debt and attempt to fix the borrower. Alternatively, they may try to seize control of struggling companies by buying their loans and bonds, and converting this debt into equity ownership – a strategy known as “loan to own”. Vulture rescues can avoid the value destruction of corporate failure. But they come at steep price: lenders will suffer major discounts to the carrying value of their loans. For this reason, commercial banks – who know their bor- rowers well and can afford to be patient – usually only sell reluctantly, if at all. However, in the aftermath of the recent credit crisis, much of this has changed. Banks are under external pressure from markets and regulators to clean up their balance sheets, restore capital adequacy and de-leverage (see graph below left). Better to take a hit and get it over with and then move on. Vultures are often given grudging respect for their ability to fix broken companies. Restructur- ing specialists have several advantages over banks. They can bring more opera- tional expertise into play; they are usually prepared to act with dispatch and be tougher (re: downsizing, concessions from unions etc.); and, most of all, they are given an incentive by rich profits. In the lingering post-credit crisis of 2011, this route to restructuring is gaining momentum. Distressed debt funds are on the rise (see graph below right). European companies are scheduled to repay more than $4 trillion by 2015. Many will be candidates for default. At the same time, Europe’s banks, faced with the threat of sovereign debt restructurings, expensive funding and higher capital requirements, are shrinking their balance sheets. In 2011, EU banks unveiled plans to slash a total of €775bn of assets (ref: <i>Vultures circle Europe’s debt mountain</i>, “Financial Times”, 2/11/11). In all, banks are more willing to cut a deal, even painful ones.
