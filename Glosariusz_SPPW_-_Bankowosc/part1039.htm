The key contributions of the reviewer func- tion to decision-making robustness are independence, just-to-sure redundan- cy and expertise. Typically, the function is embodied in a centralised location staffed by specialists (e.g. a “credit department”) who are independent of profit centre rewards (and thus able to be more dispassionate in exercising <i>banker’s judgement</i>). Depending on the bank’s system, the reviewer function may not necessarily have the authority to take the final decision. Indeed, to maintain ob-</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">jective impartiality, the reviewer function may be precluded from authorising any loans. The reviewer function is also called a pre-loan review or “preview” in some banks. It is not to be confused with the loan review of an existing facil- ity or compliance reviews of whole portfolios conducted by an internal audit function.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="165" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4557.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1038.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1040.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
