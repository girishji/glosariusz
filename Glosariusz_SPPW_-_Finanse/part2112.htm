In the pursuit of better returns, many countries resorted to equity investments, often as strategic investors. As of 2007, SWFs hold perhaps $2 trillion in assets, spread over about 40 funds. Estimates have total SWF assets topping $13 trillion within a decade (reference: “The Economist”). SWFs are often associated with bailouts perhaps because they see opportunities in bargain prices or as a way to earn a future fa- vour. In late 2007, injections from SWFs into the world’s largest banks included Abu Dhabi into USA’s Citigoup, Saudi Arabia and Singapore into Switzerland’s UBS, and China into USA’s Morgan Stanley and Blackstone Group hedge fund. Normally, attracting long term investment capital is a beneficial “vote of confi- dence” in an economy, especially if it is coming to someone’s rescue. However, the rich countries of the West and Japan are worried that state-owned SWF in- vestments from China, Russia and the Middle East will be used for political pur- poses, perhaps with a hidden agenda. In October 2007, G7 leaders met with the heads of eight SWFs and agreed on a voluntary code of best practices.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5514"><span class="s21">S&amp;P 500 </span></a><a href="part274.htm#bookmark701" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Indeks S&amp;P 500 </span><span class="s22">• </span>An index of 500 stocks formally known as the Standard and Poor’s 500 named after the well-known <i>credit rating agency</i>.

Typically this is done on a one-time basis to reduce excess levels of cash that the company cannot find productive uses for. It is better when capital is returned to shareholders where it can be more productively redeployed. A dra- matic example of such a situation was Microsoft’s cash kitty that had grown to $56 billion by 2004. It was dispensed with by a special dividend and a share buy-back scheme valued at $75 billion over 4 years (see below).
