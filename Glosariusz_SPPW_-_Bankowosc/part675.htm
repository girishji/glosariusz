The flaw is the dearth of objective measurement and the need to have bank regulators with sufficient expertise to judge what’s really going on. A condensed version of CAMEL is a “CAEL-rating” that dispenses with the more difficult assessment of bank management that can only be accomplished by on-site, face-to-face interaction. CAEL-ratings allow off-site examinations based on banks providing their own regulatory returns. If and when regulators see suspicious or deteriorating situ- ations they can then swoop in with an on-site inspection. This risk-based regu- latory approach is a more efficient use of resources when there are numerous banks to watch over.
