The model suggested that a broad range of simultaneous across- the-board defaults would be unlikely even if individual default rates might rise. The model became so popular (one banker calling it “the Black-Scholes [i.e. an ubiquitous option pricing model] for credit derivatives”) that it created a kind of self-fulfilling negative feedback loop. Based on a superficial reliance on faulty copula models, CDS investors thought that few CDOs could be bad bets. This non-common sense faith in their imperviousness to risk fuelled the US hous- ing bubble even further as the demand for mortgage loans was pushed up to unsustainable levels. Ironically, given their otherwise prudent track record, the copula model was first developed by a quant working in the NY headquarters of a <i>Canadian bank</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="421" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3173.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Gaussian <b>copula  </b>was, in hindsight, a disaster...
