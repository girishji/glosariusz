Perhaps rather surprisingly, given the <i>control culture </i>of a bank, credit manuals were not necessarily slavishly adhered to (see quote be- low). Why? In banks with widely dispersed branch networks, staff often had a degree of autonomy to deal with local lending conditions. Because of each borrower’s distinctive attributes and the role of <i>banker’s judgement</i>, decisions on the merits of a lending proposition required above all the exercise of ana- lytical thinking skills. The decision-making process was subtle, ‘organic’, not rigidly ‘formulistic’. Consulting a manual was not much help or could even be dangerous since no manual could capture all the nuances in play. Finally, for</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">a credit professional, seeking answers from a manual might seem like an abdi- cation of accountability. Thus healthy <i>credit cultures </i>operated in a “loose-tight” control framework. The basic rules were firm and strict but the boundaries left room for a healthy degree of discretionary latitude. Lest a bank become a <i>bu- reaucracy, </i>manuals were for guidance only.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3295.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We did find in the files some thick manual dictating proce- dures for the entire division, but one of the things I learned young about <b>manuals </b>is that nobody reads them.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 135pt;text-indent: -19pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">George S.

Typically, a credit officer is a relatively junior position and is usually servicing borrowing customers in a capacity as a <i>sponsor function </i>in a credit decision hierarchy. Some banks want their credit officers to be ‘jack of all trades’, handling all aspects (e.g. risk, administration and <i>cross-selling</i>) of a customer relationship. This allows professional staff skills development since the roles tend to complement and re-enforce one another i.e. the ‘all round banker’. Also customers like a bank that ‘speaks with one voice’. Other banks prefer to separate the functions. Credit officers deal exclusively with credit de- cisions. Account relationship managers handle customer care, administration</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">and cross-selling. Calling officers solicit new business.
