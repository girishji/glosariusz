Asset conversion can be a source of permanent repayment, as in the case of a seasonal bulge credit, when assets are liquidated at the end of a chain. Or, in instances where the cycle is repeated, asset conversion can allow a loan to revolve on the faith that cash can be dedicated to repayment if needed. When banks, providing short-term working capital facilities, intervene in the process and make an <i>asset conversion </i>loan they are effectively acting as a ‘bridge’ for the future receipt of cash (see quote below). This speeds up the asset conversion process to release capital that can be more productively deployed elsewhere.

For a bank, the issue of “quality” surrounds financial assets that are exposed to either market risk or <i>credit risk </i>(no one worries about cash, government securities or real estate property). Assets ‘at risk’ should be subject to rigorous risk management and conservative accounting valuations. Ideally they are liquid, earning market yields, with modest downside risk and will generate sustainable profitability over time. Asset quality is of particular interest to <i>credit rating agencies </i>and <i>regulators </i>when ascertaining a bank’s financial strength.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="240" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2643.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part608.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part610.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
