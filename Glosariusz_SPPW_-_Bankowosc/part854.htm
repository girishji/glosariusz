(A gnome is a legendary being – typically a shrivelled little old man – inhabiting the interior of the earth and acting as guardian of its treas- ures.) A more sinister connotation is that Zurich is the seat of a vast network of money power able to manipulate the rest of the world for its own selfish interests. It is both a preposterous and naive idea. But given the secrecy and im- mense wealth holdings (some of which come from questionable provenance) of the Swiss <i>private banking </i>industry, the emergence of such conspiracy theories is perhaps inevitable.

In the post-war search for the conflict’s cause an “international armaments” trade was suspected of being at work to encourage the belligerents to buy weapons.

After World War II, when the Swiss had to make amends for the Holocaust cash issue, their otherwise bland reputation was tainted.
