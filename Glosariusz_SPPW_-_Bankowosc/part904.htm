LIBOR is calculated as a ‘trimmed average’ of the funding costs of the largest, most active banks operating in London’s Eurocurrency interbank money market. Based on a concentration of lending and foreign exchange transactions in London, LIBOR thus represents the lowest real-world cost of unsecured funding and is a primary benchmark for short term interest rates globally. For purposes of transparency and neutrality, LIBOR is publicly quoted under the auspices of the British Bankers’ Association (hence its formal designation is “BBA abor”; see </a>www.bbalibor.com<span style=" color: #000;">).
