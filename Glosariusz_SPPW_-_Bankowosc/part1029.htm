The RMBS can be of varying quality, ranging from “prime” first position mortgages with lots of equity and debt service capacity (perhaps government insured) to “sub-prime” second mortgages with little or no equity and questionable debt service capacity. The RMBS market evolved in the USA. In the 1970s, most were insured by <i>govern- ment sponsored enterprises </i>and had the full faith and credit of the US government. By the 1980s, the market had morphed into a <i>securitisation </i>vehicle for banks to <i>originate-and-sell </i>RMBS to private investors based on their credit ratings. A plain vanilla RMBS with a “pass-through” structure is a security issued by a trust which allocates the cash flows from a underlying homogeneous diversified pool to the securities holders on a pro rata basis. The next market evolution was to use RMBS as the ingredients for collateralised debt obligations (CDO) by dividing asset pools into classes or <i>tranches </i>with different maturities and priorities for the receipt of cash flows. The use of a sequential payment structure or a waterfall cash allocation on the tranches meant that a range of risks could be sold to investors with varying <i>risk appetites</i>. This expanded the supply of investable capital, especially from those hungry for better returns in the low interest rate environment of the time (e.g. hedge funds). The end result of such a financial innovation that was built on the foundation of home mortgage debt was an explosion of household leverage fuelled by lucrative growth opportunities for Wall Street (see graph below). On the face of it, the innovation seemed sensible and benign (see quote below). However, there were huge systematic risks being created from an orgy of debt feeding an unsus- tainable housing asset bubble. When it burst, the RMBS with CDOs constituted the notorious toxic assets of Credit Crisis of 2007–2009.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_4495.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The implications of turning <b>home mortgages into bonds </b>were mind-bogglingly vast.
