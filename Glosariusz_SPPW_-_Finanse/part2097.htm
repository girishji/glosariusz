The conspira- tors get together to buy shares of the shorted security in unison. The resulting buying pressure pushes prices up. This hurts the short positions and tests their resolve. If those who are vulnerable or nervous panic (“we bet the wrong way!”), they will try to quickly exit their positions to limit their losses. Apart from bet- ting against the market, a part of their fear comes from the potential for unlim- ited losses. Unlike being long, there is no ceiling on their potential losses. The rush to cap their losses will force the short sellers to aggressively buy in the market. This, in turn, tends to drive up the price of stocks that have been sold short even further. A vicious spiral can then kick in: mounting losses of short sellers compel them to be even more determined to unwind their positions. They will buy even more aggressively and drive prices up even further. In this way, the “shorts” become their own worst enemy. A short squeeze can cause prices on weak shares to go up even though long-term “fundamentals” suggest a fall in price.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5477"><span class="s21">Short-termism </span></a><span class="s47">(vernacular) </span><a href="part143.htm#bookmark363" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s33">Doraźność </span><span class="s48">(żargon) </span><span class="s22">• </span><span class="s24">An approach to man- </span>agement decision making that puts an excessive emphasis on immediate results at the expense of future, long term opportunities. The <i>theory of the firm </i>suggests that shareholders want to maximise their wealth in terms of the <i>present value </i>of the future’s rewards. Therefore, they are willing to be patient but subject to the <i>time value of money </i>putting a discount on the future. Short-termism is a com- mon manifestation of the <i>agency problem</i>. In order to make budget targets or capture bonuses, etc, managers might be tempted to sacrifice the long-run health of the enterprise in exchange for quick results. Accounting profits (which only capture past performance) may be pursued at the expense of making worthwhile investments (which realize themselves only over the course of time). Other examples of short-termism include economizing measures (e.g.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">cuts in maintenance, brand support, training) that sacrifice long run value crea- tion in order to temporarily boost profits. That said, there is merit in a proper degree of focus on the “here and now”. Keynes’ dictum that “in the long run we are all dead” reflects the need for a bias for action. It is a question of balance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="90" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_7484.png"/></span></p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not on My Watch</p><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not on My Watch</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s381" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not on My Watch</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2096.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Finanse.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2098.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
