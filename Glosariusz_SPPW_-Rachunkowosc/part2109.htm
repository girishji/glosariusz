Specifically, four statements must be made:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">1. Management has ultimate responsibility for the company’s internal control systems;</p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">2. Identification of how the effectiveness of internal controls is measured; the frame- work developed by <i>Committee of Sponsoring Organisations (COSO) </i>is a benchmark;</p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">3. Based on #2 above, how effective are the controls, including a disclosure of any “material weaknesses” if such exists;</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">4. The auditor has issued an <i>attestation report </i>that is part of the annual report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 404 was intended as cure for the deeper malaise of <span class="s27">accounting risk</span>. First, it forced management to pay more attention to its internal controls, the background architecture of a company’s accounting system. Second, by assuring investors of a sys- tematic design to generate <span class="s27">earnings quality</span>, confidence in the accounts – weakened after so many <span class="s27">accounting scandals </span>– would be strengthen. While laudable, Section 404 has not been without its controversy. Some wonder if it is over-kill. Another issue is its expense. It is a greater burden to smaller companies (see graph below). Many firms have had to hire consultants to help them determine their status and/or have had to pay higher <span class="s27">audit fees</span>. Certainly, the <span class="s27">Big Four </span>auditors are not complaining about Section</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">404. (There is a certain perverse irony in such windfall prosperity when it was egregious</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">instances of <span class="s27">audit failure </span>that prompted Sarbanes-Oxley in the first place.) Offsetting this concern is that many of the costs are one-time, especially once gaps in control framework were filled. As well, there is a genuinely pressing need to restore investor confidence in the world’s largest <span class="s27">capital market. </span>In the words of the chairman of the <span class="s27">Public Accounting Oversight Board: </span>“there will be real questioning of whether this free- market system really works” (“Financial Times”, 1 December 2005, p. 12) if delicate investor confidence is attacked by more accounting scandals. Because of its cost, impact and the stakes involved, Section 404 “represents the biggest reform of financial report- ing in the US in 75 years” (“Financial Times”, 3 November 2005, p. 9).</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2108.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-Rachunkowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2110.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
