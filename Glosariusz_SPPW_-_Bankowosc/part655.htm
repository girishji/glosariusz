Along with powerful nation states, Barings was called one “of the six great powers of Europe” (attributed to the Duc de Richelieu). In fact, the house of <i>Rothschild </i>was the greater of the two. When North America was an emerg- ing market in the 19<span class="s342">th </span>century, Barings was especially renowned for financing railways through the sale of bonds in London (The railway town of Revelstoke in Canada is named after a Baring peer). Barings would have two ‘near death’ experiences. One would prove fatal. In 1890, because of Argentinean defaults, it was technically insolvent. Fearing contagion, a consortium of banks from the <i>City </i>under the tutelage of the Governor of the Bank of England organised</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="299" height="199" alt="image" src="Image_2871.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">a rescue (at that point, the Bank of England itself was still not yet prepared to acknowledge any <i>lender of last resort </i>responsibilities). While Barings survived, the resulting turmoil in the financial markets triggered the Panic of 1890. The family itself was financially ruined, taking ten years to settle the rescue debts. The newly incorporated bank survived as a shadow of its old self. More than a century later, Barings unexpectedly failed after a <i>rogue </i>(<i>lender</i>/<i>trader</i>) racked up losses of $1.3 billion. It is tempting to demonise an over-incentivized (or pressured) individual (see quote below). But the real fault was organisational rot: weak internal controls and poor <i>oversight. </i>Top management didn’t know what was going on. While the Bank of England had long since accepted its <i>central bank</i>ing responsibilities, it consciously declined to rescue Barings the second time around. Barings’ failure did not threaten other banks and thus it was deemed not to qualify for the <i>too big to fail doctrine. </i>Its assets and liabili- ties were transferred to another foreign bank (Holland’s ING) for a nominal sum (telling us that there was still value in the name). Most of the bank’s credi- tors got out unscathed. While a great name was gone, the losses were primar- ily to the shareholder’s</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">and to the reputation of the British establish- ment. Barings would not be the only bank to suffer from rogue trad- ers. Later, France’s So- ciete General (€4.9 b in 2008) and Switzerland’s UBS ($2.3b in 2011)</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">would also fall prey to the same thing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="175" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_2872.png"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 266pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barriers to Selling (in Banking) <span class="s27">759</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_2873.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In order to make money in such a market, the [global mar- ket speculators] need not only that tiny extra edge: they also need to make larger and larger bets on top of it...

Examples of barriers to selling would include the seller’s lack of knowledge about the product’s features (vs. competing offers in the marketplace) or potential benefits (features that appeal to the buyer’s particular needs and wants); the buyer’s lack of certainty about his/her wants and needs; the seller’s lack of credibility and the buyer’s in- herent mistrust of sales ‘pitches’. Eventually, barriers have to be eliminated into order for there to be a “close” i.e. a decision to buy. This is done either through a clarification process or as a result of the buyer shopping elsewhere. Banking is fundamentally no different although in the case of an existing bank customer, the barriers can be more pronounced.
