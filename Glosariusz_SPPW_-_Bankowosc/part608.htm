When currencies were allowed to depreciate in order to restore export competitiveness, highly leveraged hard currency borrowers faced local currency <i>debt servicing </i>increases and often bankruptcy. The damage wrought by the financial crisis on the real economies was considerable (GDP per capita (on a purchasing power parity basis) falling by about 5–20%). Other emerging markets outside the region also suffered from a global investment <i>flight to quality</i>. A long term knock-on effect was the rise of foreign currency surpluses by Asian economies anxious to avoid currency runs in the future. This lead to capital surpluses in the USA from foreign inflows and in turn suppressed interest rates. Such cheap capital lead to aggressive leveraging and asset bubbles, one of the causalities of the Credit Crisis of 2007–2009. While the region quickly bounced back, the most enduring lesson is need for sound financial practices in high growth emerging markets.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1700"><span class="s22">Asset Conversion </span></a><a href="part504.htm#bookmark1490" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Upłynnienie aktywów </span>– The transformation of non-liquid <i>assets, </i>typically inventory and <i>receivables, </i>into cash<i>. </i>(Since fixed assets are not usually sold, but are rather used up in the production process, they are not normally associated with asset conversion).
