Complacent, relationship-oriented lenders may give them the “benefit of the doubt” even when they show warning signs (see </span>liquidity vs. solvency distinction<span class="p">). Such a borrower may not necessarily be bankrupt so long as creditors chose to forebear. Even healthy companies can touch a zone of unsustainable leverage as they thrive and grow. Because equity is so expensive relative to debt, they will only periodically raise new “chunks” of equity to restore a healthy capital structure. In the meantime, they can “live with” high leverage. A business in a seasonal trade will typically be temporarily over-leveraged in the midst of its inventory build up before earnings have realised from compressed sales. Most </span>highly leveraged trans- actions <span class="p">have unsustainable debt levels pending being placed on a more permanent footing (say, by improving cash flow, sale of assets or raising new equity). Here a lack of sustainability is obvious and is usually explicitly addressed. Or, some- times previously viable enterprises in declining “sunset” industries slowly become the “living dead”. They drift along but cannot escape their fate. In the absence of opportunities to improve their operational capacity, the only remedy to insolven- cy is a debt restructuring which reduces debt to an amount which can be carried. In the case of </span>sovereign <span class="p">debt, debt loads are deemed to be unsustainable when unhealthy public finances cannot be remedied even by harsh austerity measures (which are either politically intolerable or insufficient – “you can’t get blood out of a stone”). Something has to give. A common benchmark is when debt service payments to foreign national are more than 25% of export revenues and the total debt load is more than 250% of annual export earnings. Such borrowers are on a treadmill of debt and usually need debt relief. At the end of the day, sustainabil- ity can be an ambivalent state of mind. It often “boils down to” what the markets will let you “get away with”. Banks that can manage the </span>confidence game <span class="p">can enjoy high leverage but might face a sudden </span>run <span class="p">if they “drop the ball”. When mar- kets become nervous, sustainability is harder to achieve. For example, at the time of this compendium’s writing, the debt sustainability of many EU countries (see </span>PIGS<span class="p">) was a source of much uncertainty and anxiety.</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3188">Unwind a Position </a><span class="s52">(vernacular) </span><a href="part303.htm#bookmark1127" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Odwinąć pozycję </span><span class="s32">(potoczne) </span><span class="s65">– </span><span class="p">To get out of future exposure by liquidating in the market. The position refers to either long (i.e. having bought &gt; sell) or short (i.e. having sold &gt; buy back). The term is particularly associated with traded securities and financial instruments such as derivatives (see quote below). If the investor has a position where intrinsic value has an unrealised gain (“in the money”), they would be “profit taking”. In unwinding, the inference is that there is an unrealised loss which the investor accepts in order to cap future increases in losses.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="34" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4962.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1138.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1140.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
