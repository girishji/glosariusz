Inter-company transactions, such as dividends, loans, guar- antees, management fees and inter-company trade etc., are controlled or re- stricted. Since ring fencing is an internal meddling in what otherwise would be productive integrated operations, it tends to be most resorted to when there are insolvency concerns. An example might be a subsidiary with either operat- ing deficits or capital expenditure needs which could drain the parent of scarce cash flow. If lenders to the parent were anxious about cash flow drainage from ‘their’ repayment source, they could “ring fence” the subsidy by insisting, in a <i>covenant</i>, that financial support be limited or even denied completely. In the</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">spirit of “sink or swim”, the troubled subsidiary would then have to self-finance itself. Moreover, lenders to the weaker subsidy would be denied any subsidies from other lenders in the group. Most importantly, the troubled entity could not drag down the rest of the group should it end up sinking. In a <i>restructuring</i>, ring fencing forces autonomous operating units to fend for themselves. A <i>cross guarantee </i>is the opposite of ring fencing because it integrates separate legal en- tities into one economic unit. Ring fencing can be applied to banks (see quote</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="79" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_4579.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1043.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1045.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
