It matters not that the advance may be long overdue, or that the security has become depreciated, or the transac- tions on the account unsatisfactory, or that you wish to re- duce advances generally. The borrower will refuse to be conciliated. Is it possible – he will ask you, with unconscio- us insolence – that a large bank like yours can want the money? If not, why put him to inconvenience, so long as he pays you good interest for it? Have you lost confidence in him? If not, why disturb <b>an arrangement which has gone on for so long </b>without a word of objection on your part. The man who takes this perverted view of things will be transformed into a life-long enemy, whenever the Bank shall insist upon having its own again, whether his posi- tion be sound or the reverse… It would not be an unheard of thing if he charged you and your advances with his ruin</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">– an rancorous accusation, when your accuser is about to repay your good nature by a dividend the minuteness of which is a satire on your credulity.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 193pt;text-indent: 28pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Excerpted from “Recall of Advances” in <i>The Country Banker </i>(1899) by George Rae</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2414">Hard Currency Loans in Emerging Markets </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark450" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark450" class="s24">Finansowanie kredyta- </a><span class="s60">mi w twardych walutach na rynkach wschodzących </span><span class="p">– Borrowing in</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">a stronger currency with a lower interest rate and using the proceeds as well as repaying the debt in a local currency. Thus, a borrower has a hard currency loan denominated in their local currency. In the absence of having cash flow streams in the hard currency or setting up a hedge, the borrower is thus exposed to for- eign currency risk: if the local currency depreciates against the hard currency, the local currency cost of servicing interest and principal will increase. Rela- tive to local currency cash streams, the debt burden will be heavier. Of course, the exchange rate can go the other way and benefit the borrower. Thus, hard</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="241" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3783.png"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 217pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hard Currency Loans in Emerging Markets <span class="s27">963</span></p><p style="padding-top: 21pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">currency borrowing breaks a fundamental <i>matching </i>principle in finance and is arguably an unintended form of speculation. Moreover, since the economic theory of interest rate parity tells us that the difference in nominal interest rates must equal the difference between spot and forward rates, there is no appar- ent advantage to be gained by borrowing in a ‘cheaper’ interest rate currency. As an example of the money illusion, lower interest costs should be offset by higher hard currency conversion costs. That said, borrowers in many emerg- ing market countries actually take hard currency loans (see graph below). For example, residential mortgage debt in Central Europe is often denominated in Swiss francs because homeowners perceive an interest rate advantage. In actual fact, despite interest rate parity (an observed long run tendency vs. an immuta- ble law), this may be the case. First, some hard currency economies have lower real (i.e. before inflation) interest rates compared to emerging markets where pools of savings are relatively modest compared to investment demands from their high rates of growth. Secondly, ‘safe haven’ currencies such as the Swiss franc are often already fully-valued and therefore less likely to appreciate con- sistently with interest rate parity. In the absence of a foreign currency crisis, emerging market borrowers may in fact enjoy a true interest rate advantage in hard currency loans. That said, complications will arise if foreign currency borrowing becomes significant (say, 20%+ of all lending). Banks must gain ac- cess to foreign currency deposits (this is sometimes made easier if the bank has a large foreign parent). Government economic policy is constrained since cur- rency devaluation (to boost competitiveness and reduce capital flow deficits) will result in higher domestic debt service costs and in turn reduced consump- tion demand. This tends to depress domestic economic activity sterilising the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="411" height="0" alt="image" src="Image_3784.png"/></span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hard Currency Mortgages</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 185pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="181" height="143" alt="image" src="Image_3785.png"/></span></p><p class="s115" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">2008</p><p class="s115" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">2008</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s115" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">2008</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 158pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 143%;text-align: right;">Latvia Estonia Hungary Lithuania Romania Poland Bulgaria Slovakia Czech</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s36" style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Source: National Bank of Hungary/“The Economist”, 10 October 2009, p. 75</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="416" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3786.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="212" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3787.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part861.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part863.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
