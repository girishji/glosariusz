A club deal is in many ways similar to a syn- dicated loan, but without an agent or a single agreement which all banks sign. A club deal is typically operated as a “partnership amongst equals”. Individual banks will have a relationship with the borrower and seldom permit a sell down of <i>exposure </i>to other participants. The logic behind a club deal is that it is way to collectively benefit by capping single-name exposure without losing the status of being a <i>house bank</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: -28pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1963"><span class="s22">Coin </span></a><a href="part236.htm#bookmark659" style=" color: #7C7B7B; font-family:&quot;Minion Pro&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 16pt;">• </a><span class="s60">Moneta </span><span class="s64">– </span>A piece of metal with a standardised design and fixed weight that circulates as <i>money</i>. Coins are one of the oldest forms of money with roots in antiquity (see quote below). Originally, they were standardised measures of pre- cious metal that replaced the awkward tedium of using scales and weighing pieces of metal. Today, their value emanates from their government-sanctioned status as legal tender. While coins can be used as a substitute for <i>paper money, </i>practical considerations dictate otherwise<i>. </i>A coin is heavier than a <i>banknote, </i>is not easily carried in a wallet and costs 3–4 times more to manufacture. Banks and stores also have higher costs in handling coinage. But coins can stay un- damaged in circulation for 10–20 times longer and offer advantages as pocket change. For these reasons, coins have the most consumer appeal and economic usage for small transactions (in 2002, there was $7.7 billion of coins in circula-</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">tion in the USA – “International Herald Tribune”, 8/03/02, p. 13). While elec- tronic money in the form of smart cards may have made coins obsolete, many in the public still prefer to use ‘loose change’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="103" height="4" alt="image" src="Image_3066.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part700.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Glosariusz_SPPW_-_Bankowosc.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part702.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
